Gloom is an atmospheric team play modification for Quake II that pits humans against a team of alien spiders. The object of the game is to obliterate the opposing team by killing their troops and destroying their spawn points. Each team has six classes which can be bought with frags earned, as well as two base classes.

Of those base classes, one is a builder class with the responsibility to build and maintain defensive structures and spawn points for its team. Advanced mapping functions can create mission-style maps with different objectives, random bases, and a whole ton of special features you wouldn't see in standard Quake II.

The depth of Gloom lies in the radical differences between its teams as well as the versatility of the builder classes that have the power to make every game truly unique. The fun of Gloom lies in using teamwork and class advancement to dominate each game.	

Before downloading and jumping straight into a game, it is essential you read the readme, set up your key bindings and learn the ability of each class and how best to use them, especially the builder classes. Gloom takes a lot of time to master, don't be put off if you find yourself always dying. Check out the strategy guide from the main page, and be sure to read that readme!
