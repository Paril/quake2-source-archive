Hello!

Paril here, creator of Strogg Deathmatch (hereon referred to as StroggDM), and many other mods including AQC, SVSHCTF and ReloadQ2.

This mod pins you in Quake2 maps, whichever you want, with all weapons replaced with ammo. Why? Because you're a Strogg, you cannot use Human weapons. Anyways, when you enter, follow the menu to select your Strogg class. Once you enter the game, get ready to feel the best Strogg experience you're ever had. Get ready to "Be the Strogg, Feel the Strogg and Fight the Strogg!"
