ABOUT
=====

The PIG 2000 is a weapon that looks like the BFG (cos I used the model with a
slightly different skin) but behaves very differently. Point it at a baddy
and fire, and something very odd will happen to them. How odd? That's
different every time. Results vary from a barrel getting dropped on their
head to them turning into a sheep.

As from PIG2K v1.1, you can now use it in multiplayer. This means you can
inflict nasty random effects on your enemies and better yet, your friends.

The source code for PIG2K is freely available from the Psychosoft website.
If you have any questions or comments on how cool the PIG is (I like those)
or whatever, feel free to e-mail me.

VERSION HISTORY
===============

[version 1.1]
-fixed a major bug that was causing a lot of crashes
-added multiplayer support
[version 1.0]
-initial release

USING THE PIG
=============

To install it, simply unzip the archive (with directories) to your Quake2
dir. Then run Quake2 with the following command line:

quake2 +set game pig2k

Just start a game, and whenever you get the BFG you'll also get the PIG.
To use the PIG, type at the console (or bind a key to) 'use PIG2K'.

In multiplayer, it works basically the same, although there's an added
dmflag:
DF_FREE_PIG	2097152
Adding this flag means everyone gets the PIG2K and 50 cells (about enough
for a single shot) when they connect or respawn. If you don't know how
dmflags work, open your eyes and look at one of the billions of Q2 server
config FAQ's.

BACKGROUND
==========

The PIG 2000 is a wierd project that wasn't quite finished when the invasion
of Strogg started. A few units were sent anyway, as intellegence wasn't
exactly sure what to expect. You never know when strange pieces of hardware
are going to come in handy.

PIG stands for Physical Improbability Generator. PIGs have the ability to
generate random anomalies in time and space. It is based on the design of
the BFG. A scientist accidentally stumbled across the BFG's ability when
trying to improve its range. Unfortuanately, after a few weeks of research,
the scientist turned himself into a can of baked beans. His research notes
were discovered though, and the PIG was improved.

The PIG 2000 has been designed so its possible outcomes are limited, but
what it will actually do when you fire it off is still a random chance.
Common outcomes found in combat tests are as follows:

Instant Gib: The victim spontaeneously combusts.
Transform: The target will transform into another object, usually something
close by, but there are reports of targets turning into farm animals.
Reality Move: The target gets moved to another plane of reality. What
happens to it afterwards is not known, but the move does create a small
shockwave.
Squash: An object falls on the target.
Swap: You and your target swap places.
Invert: The target's gravity is inverted. This causes it to fly up, and due
to the strength of the reverse gravity, it will squish when it hits anything.

Due to the random outcome, the power it takes to generate also varies. It
does have a cutout that will limit it to 50 standard cells.

LEGAL CRAP
==========

The basics of it is, if this buggers up your system (although I can't see
how it could) it ain't my fault.

Feel free to distribute this as much as you like, as long as it stays in
its original form with this readme. If you want to put it on a commercial
CD, you will have to get my OK first. If you don't ask me first I'll get
really cut.

Enough crap, go play with the spanky new weapon.
