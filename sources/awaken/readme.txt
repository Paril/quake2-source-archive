Awakening Release 1

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Unzip using pathnames then run Quake2.exe +set game awaken +deathmatch 1 +map adm1


IMPORTANT GAMEPLAY INFORMATION


The four maps in this release are ADM1, ADM2, ADM3, and ADM4.

Hand grenades are actually C4 plastic explosives which can stick to walls and be detonated at will. To detonate a C4,
press G.

The orange spider-like devices are Tractor Beam traps. When thrown they will stick to the first surface they hit and wait for
an opponent to come within range. Once an opponent is within range the trap will shoot out a laser hook which will grab the 
opponent and pull the towards the trap while doing damage. To escape a trap, you can simply shoot one and if hit, the trap
will fall apart.

Certain weapons have secondary firing modes and they are:

2) Gauss Pistol
7) Rocket Launcher
9) Shock Gun

To use the secondary mode select that weapon twice. For example, if you want to use the secondary mode for the gauss pistol
you would press 2 to select the weapon, then once the weapon is selected, press 2 again.


DESCRIPTIONS FOR WEAPONS WHICH HAVE SECONDARY MODES

2)Gauss Pistol: Primary mode is a simple blaster which charges up. At full charge, a single shot will kill an unarmored 
opponent. Secondary mode uses cell ammo that fires something similar to a railgun shot. This mode is special in that the
gun can target in and shoot enemies through walls. This mode would be good for killing a person camping in a well defended
area.

7) Rocket launcher: The primary mode fires guided rockets, meaning the rockets will move to whichever point you have the 
crosshair aimed. The secondary mode fires normal rockets.

9) Shock Gun: Primary mode fires a blue ball of energy which will disintigrate an opponent on direct hit. If it is not a 
direct hit, the energy will freeze the opponent for a couple seconds. Secondary mode fires a ball of green plasma which can 
follow the opponent around corners.

All other weapons are self explanatory.


ITEMS AND POWERUPS

The Awakening: This powerup looks like an 'A' with a ring around it. For the amount of damage you inflict you will gain that 
exact amount of health when you have this powerup. It's basically like health point vampirism.

D89: This powerup looks like a syringe. It is a drug which gives you 50% damage resistance for a short period of time. 
If you manage to use another D89 powerup before the first one has worn off, you will take poison damage.

Haste: This powerup looks like a pair of wings with a ring around them. It makes you fire all weapons much faster.

Mystery Box: This will give you random powerups.

Environment Suit: This is the standard Quake 2 environment suit. It is listed here because it makes the player invincible to 
the flamethrower. 


SPECIAL DEATHMATCH SERVER FLAGS

DF_FAST_SWITCH       65536  This allows fast switching of weapons.
DF_EXTRA_ITEMS      131072  This spawns random powerups at the DM spawn points. 
DF_NO_REPLACEMENTS  262144  This flag runs the mod without Awaken-specific powerups. Instead it uses the normal Quake2 ones.

Thank you for playing Awakening. -redchurch

[  l i g h t  ]

A single player/deathmatch level for the Awakening mod ( http://www.planetquake.com/awaken )

* RELEASE NOTES *

- I'd recommend that you play this map on a system equipped with a 3D accelerator (especially in
  single player mode).  Software users may encounter some problems with slowdown and/or models
  dissapearing. 

- Let me repeat for the sake of emphasis that you need to have the Awakening Mod installed to
  properly play this level.  Otherwise it'll be really unbalanced and a few sounds will be
  missing.

- The level has been tested and balanced for Awakening release 1.  It should work fine with
  release 2 (assuming it ever becomes available for download) but if it doesn't then it's not
  my fault.

- I wouldn't mind hearing what you think of this level (unless you're Sean Kildare whom I'd
  rather NOT hear from, thank you very much) so feel free to email me about it.


* STORY *

	This map takes place a few years before the events of Quake when the government conducted
the first slipgate test in an abandoned mining colony on one of the moons of Jupiter.  This
concentrated release of energy emanating from our star system was what first alerted the Strogg
as to our presence.  They immediately came to the conclusion that any race advanced enough to
build such a powerful device posed a serious threat to their civilization and should be
destroyed.  They also discovered that by locking on to the gate's signal they might be able to
use it to their advantage.  That's where your story begins.  I guess.

                                            . . .

	It's been a few days since the sounds of gunfire stopped and you've decided it's safe to
assume that the creatures have taken over the entire complex.  You're not sure why they're still
keeping a few of you alive but the other day you saw them collecting the bodies of your comrades
so they apparently have some use for humans, dead ones anyway.  They also somehow forgot to
search you for weapons so you still have your pistol and a full clip of bullets.  That clip looks
kinda useless now, however, since you'll only need one bullet to use on yourself when the time
comes.

	You're suddenly startled by some sort of inhuman yell and look up to see that the
forcefield for your cell has shorted out and two creatures, both bent on eliminating you no
doubt, are headed in your direction.  You waste no time in emptying your clip into the two
montrosities and cautiously emerge from the cell.  Then it suddenly dawns upon you that you have
nowhere to go.  You know for a fact that the shuttlecraft, the only means of getting off the
planet, were all either taken or destroyed leaving you in more or less the same situation you
were in a few minutes ago.

	Then you remember the slipgate.  It wasn't thought that it could transmit organic matter
but those things, whatever they are, seem to have proven otherwise. You're not real eager to meet
what's on the other side of thing but it seems like a slightly better idea than staying where you
are.  Especially if the government decides to destroy the base, something you gather they've been
notorious for in the past.  As you grow accustomed to your surroundings you realize that you're
situated just a few rooms away from where the slipgate is stored.  It shouldn't be that hard to
fight your way there... should it?
