NOTES
===============================

The original baseline for the mod was the CTF v1.50 source code (from way back in 1998). It's had a lot ripped out, and a lot more added - not just from me, but from several other authors as well who have kindly allowed their code to be used in this project.

Feel free to make use of the code as you like. All I ask is that you give credit where it is due if you use any of the code in your own applications or mods.

This source code is provided as-is with no warranties of any kind. If it causes something unspeakably evil to happen, you're on your own ;)
