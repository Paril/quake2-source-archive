1. Foreword and Disclaimer
--------------------------
NOTE:
You can get information about updates, forthcoming cool stuff, etc. through
our mailing list. You can visit our website (address above) for more
information.

We're also looking for permanent servers :) If you would like to run
Annihilation on your server, please email ann@telefragged.com and we'll come
play it! Your server will also be publicised on Annihilation's website.

Also, If you have a related site and would like to link to us, visit our site
and we'll link back to you :)

OK, let's get the disclaimer out of the way to start with (yawn)...

*** START READING HERE ***
Hi, and welcome to the readme file of Annihilation Q2, a compilation of extra
weapons, defensive and offensive, items, and cool new features for Quake 2.
This mod was inspired by the Killer Quake Pack for Quake, a great compilation
of patches written by the author and other QC programmers. This mod is the
same kind of thing - I've written code where necessary, but if someone else
released some code that I thought would be good in the mod I've used their
code, modifying it as necessary. All authors are credited (see the credits
section), and no code was used or modified without the author's permission.
Similarly, no code was just stuck in the mod "out of the box". All code
fragments have been extensively examined and modified to make sure they fit
the theme of this mod, and extra features have been added. Thanks guys, you
saved me a lot of coding! Without your work, Annihilation wouldn't exist.

OK, on with the readme!

2. Installation
---------------
To start with, you MUST have the Quake 2 3.20 patch installed. This can be
obtained from http://www.idsoftware.com/hot/index.html .

If you have installed previous versions of Annihilation and customised any
config files, you should back them up now, as they will be replaced by newer
ones when the new install file is run. You can recover your old files and add
any required new commands to them from the new files.

If you have any savegames, new maps, new models, etc. they will be left intact.

OK, run the install file. You will be asked where to install the files.
Select your Quake 2 directory. A directory will be created off the Quake 2
directory called "ann", and the files unzipped into here. If it exists already
then the files will be updated to the new version.

If you want to play the Threewave CTF maps (Q2CTF1..Q2CTF5), you should rename
the PAK0.PAK file in your CTF directory to PAK3.PAK (or another unused
PAK?.PAK) and move it into the "baseq2" directory. This will allow you to play
these maps with all Quake2 modifications. You do not need to copy this file to
play other CTF maps, though. See the procedure for installing new maps, below.
If you want CTF and do not have it, you can get it from
http://captured.com/threewave .

For information about enabling/disabling CTF mode, see "Other Notes", below...

To use viewable weapons, you just need to have the VWEP patch installed. You
do not need to copy any files. I think VWEP comes with the 3.19+ patches, but
if you don't have it (PAK2.PAK in your baseq2 directory) you can do a search
on the net for it.

To start the game, run Quake 2 with the +set game ann command line, i.e.
c:\quake2\quake2 +set game ann

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If the game does not function correctly, first make sure that a config.cfg or
autoexec.cfg does not exist in the quake2 directory (not its subdirectories,
they're OK). After trying the game again, you can try deleting your
annihilation directory and reinstalling from scratch. If you're still having
trouble you can post a message on the message board on our site, or email us.

  Connect to sys.grailhall.com:27950
Light Saber
+ Damage has been increased (a lot), kick has been decreased
AnnKeys.cfg
+ I've added a config file, annkeys.cfg, containing the default key bindings.

-------------------
Cell Regeneration

  more info, of course
Guided Missiles
+ Guided missiles are now vulnerable! They can be shot down by any projectile 
  or laser-based weapon
+ New model!
+ New skin!

  certain ways. These have been fixed!
Nukes
+ Nukes are vulnerable too :)
+ Their speed has been increased slightly
Sniper Zooming
+ Fixed jerkiness problem at high zoom levels
Torture Chambers
+ Now cost 200 cells, evil things!
+ On destroying an enemy chamber you will now be given the number of frags that 
  the chamber has had, not just 5 all the time :)
+ When the "Cannot project into solid" error was generated, the cells for 
  payment were taken anyway. Fixed!
+ Another one of Dave's weird bugs! If you kill a medic, gib it, and watch it's 
  gibs for a couple of seconds, a torture chamber was automatically spawned from
  the gibs! FIXED!
Airstrike
+ Hehe - if you had guided missiles selected when you called an airstrike, the 
  payload would be guided :) Fixed!
ANN Turret
+ Removed due to instability of the Quake2 engine :^(
Cloaking
+ Now costs fewer cells per frame, and handled server-side
Cloaking Jammer
+ Now costs fewer cells per frame, and handled server-side
LaserDrones
+ They now fire at nukes, guided missiles, other LaserDrones, etc.
+ There were problems with the code that caused LaserDrones to sometimes do 
  little or no damage
+ Drones are now vulnerable at all times, including arming-time
+ They can now be destroyed by laser-based weaponry

LaserBlaster
+ New model
Freezer
+ New model
+ New VWEP
+ Doubled the fire rate (except when the player is carrying a Time Accel)
Fake Death
+ I think I broke it last time - while faking you just appeared to be crouching, 
  but it's been fixed now, and you also _always_ drop your weapon now
+ Certain important commands stopped working after using fake death, such as 
  drop, give, etc, but this has been fixed
Disruptor Rifles
+ The hyperblastertype command would not loop round under certain combinations
  of allow flags
Demo
+ Added a demo that will play on startup. To disable it, see below...
Phaser
+ Shots now cost only 100 cells

New to Version 1.21
-------------------
ALLOW Utils
+ FragAngeL wrote a neat program to calculate values for the ann_allow and
  ann_allow2 variables depending on your desired game configuration
ANN Turret
+ Wrote the code
+ Designed the turret
+ Added a turret to annctf2.bsp
Jetpack
+ Changed the skin slightly
Torture Chamber
+ Now traps enemies in single player
LaserDrone
+ Now attack enemies in single player
+ Fixed the bug where sometimes the lasers did no damage
Icon
+ Made a nice new icon :)
Console Background
+ Changed it again :)

New to Version 1.20
-------------------
The Annihilation Team
+ Please welcome FragAngeL, our new mapper :)
Fake Death
+ Stopped players being able to fake death inside torture chambers, and
  therefore not be hurt
+ Fixed a bug that caused the game to crash when you tried to drop the light
  saber (for example, when faking death)
Sniper Rifle
+ New model - now it looks like a rifle of some kind :)
+ New skin to go with it
+ Removed the railgun hum
+ Added a VWEP model too :)
Light Saber
+ Wrote the code
+ Added models
+ Added a skin
+ Added sounds
Disruptor Rifle
+ Added a new model
+ New skin
+ Fixed the animation so the weapon needs to be re-cocked after 3 shots, and
  so that you can fire less than 3 shots if you want to
+ Fixed a sound problem
+ Reduced the disruptor bolts' damage slightly
Phaser
+ New model
+ New skin
+ Changed the beam width (is now kept thin, doesn't expand)
Flashlight
+ Now uses up cells more slowly than it did before (Duracell Bunny =] )
ZBOT Detection
+ Scrapped, and replaced with...
Bot Detection
+ Now detects all kinds of bots, not just the ZBOT - it does all the same things
  as before, while also allowing you to log bots to a file
Time
+ Added a CRLF to the end of the time string, so your console stays readable :)
IR Goggles
+ Now you can see monsters too (as was originally intended)
Ammo Converter
+ Stopped the converter converting past the maximum amount of ammo you could
  carry (Dave spotted this when he switched to his sniper rifle and found that
  he had 475 slugs!)
Hyperblaster Types
+ The "blastertype" command has been changed to "hyperblastertype" to allow for
  expansion of the Blaster
Torture Chamber
+ Will no longer capture DM teammates
+ They now do more damage, so they can kill the player with the AutoDoc
+ Fixed a bug that printed out 2 obituaries when the torture chamber killed 
  someone
Easter Egg
+ There is now an Annihilation-specific easter egg built into the game (Why am
  I telling you? - Otherwise no-one would find it :] ). Hint: Look around on
  the last level, BOSS2. Anyway, the lamers won't be reading this file, just
  mailing me "How do I load ann?! Do I need a keyboard?"
Proximity Mines
+ Proximity mines no longer stick to moving surfaces (doors, lifts, rotating
  things, etc.) - they used to stick there and then float in the position they
  were thrown, even when the solid had moved away!
ANN Pause
+ The pause message is now only shown when someone pauses or unpauses the
  game, not every 2 frames or whatever it was before :) This allows you to
   chat, etc. while the game is paused
Guided Missiles
+ You can now get a rocket's-eye-view when you fire a guided rocket - the way
  they were supposed to be :)
+ Guided rockets now cost 5 rockets because of this advantage
Maps
+ FragAngeL did Toxic, a great DM map - the filename is maps/anndm1.bsp
AnnPlay
+ Wrote the great program that lets you play almost any kind of audio file or
  stream through Quake2, with the help of Winamp :) See the AnnPlay section,
  below

New to version 1.19
-------------------
This version was not released publically - it only existed for about a week
while extensive testing and debugging took place.

New to Version 1.18
-------------------
Version 1.17 was withdrawn because Borland didn't tell me that I needed to
distribute a runtime DLL. I've made a few bugfixes and the new setup program
includes this missing DLL.
Pipebombs
+ Now when you die, pipebombs tagged onto you are removed
Disruptor Rifle
+ Fixed the obituary message
Rocket types
+ Removed the white-screen "blinding" effect from all rockets except the Nuke
  (as was intended)
Cluster Grenades
+ Fixed the obituary message
Phaser
+ I broke the phaser last version (it crashed the server =]) - Fixed now

New to Version 1.17
-------------------
The Annihilation Team
+ Please welcome our new modeller, Ese Casco (real name Rodrigo Reyes) to the
  team! You should see a few models by him very soon (like next version),
  including weapon models, etc...
Game DLL
+ Rebuilt the DLL in Borland so the dedicated server works properly (problem
  with LCC stopped the dedicated server when the DLL was unloaded on a map
  change, for example. Anyone wanna fragfest?! =] BWAHAHA!
Nukes
+ Nukes now blind everyone in the vicinity of their impact for a few seconds :)
Disruptor Rifle
+ Wrote the code
+ Made the model for the disruptor bolts
+ Made a humming sound for the disruptor bolts =)
+ Drew an icon
Weapon Sounds
+ Fixed them :) Before, if you had tech powerups the original sounds for the
  weapon you were using would be played (railgun instead of sniper rifle,
  bfg10k instead of phaser)
New Weapons
+ Now the game will switch weapons automatically when you run out of ammo for
  a new weapon (like the original ones)
Client Connection
+ Now when a client connects, their IP address is revealed to the server
ZBOT Detection
+ I rewrote the anti-ZBOT code myself (WhiteFang won't provide a
  Borland-compiled object file, or answer his email), and I think it works
  better now - It will detect the bot as soon as the owner accesses the
  ZBOT-menu
Ammo Converter
+ Fixed a bug that caused the conversion speed to change depending on how many
  clients were converting! (I was using a static frame-count variable in the
  convert function, which was being updated by all the clients)
Radar
+ Fixed a mini-mini-bug that could potentially mess up the zoom range flashing
  (same reason as above)
+ Added ability to hide cloaked players from the radar display
  (ANN_ALLOW2_RADARHIDECLOAKERS)
Laser Sight/Flashlight
+ Implemented the code
+ Made the flashlight cost cells
+ Made a model and skins for the laser dot
+ Separated the laser sight and flashlight modes
IR Goggles
+ Wrote the code
Respawn Protection
+ Wrote the code
+ Added a console variable to control protection time
Map Rotation
+ Wrote the code
+ Wrote a sample .rot file

New to Version 1.16
-------------------
Dave Walmsley (GP)
- Lamer (finally done (some) models :))
Pipebombs
+ Pipebombs now stick to monsters and other players so you can taunt them
  before detonation :) Picking up health will remove the pipebomb
+ Range has been reduced to 1536 units
+ Now costs 3 grenades per pipebomb
+ Pipebombs cannot be left on/near start positions (like proximity mines) (or
  they would instantly tag people entering the level or respawning :))
+ New VWEP model
Proximity Mines
+ New VWEP model
+ New in-hand model
Deathmatch scores
+ Removed the time from the scoreboards - if was difficult to read other text
Time
+ Added a time command to replace the deathmatch scoreboard clock, to keep
  track during those all-nighters :)
Defence Lasers
+ Can no longer attach defence lasers to moving surfaces (lifts, etc.) which
  would cause minor problems
Marine Radio
+ Fixed the radio_power variable :) In the previous version it used the
  server's setting for everyone
Server commands
+ The "sv players" or "sv who" command now displays IP addresses
Console variables
+ Given a few variables archive capability (see Other Notes, below)
ZBOT Protection
+ Implemented the detector code
+ Developed zbot_protect variable and checks
Radar
+ Wrote the code (pages of trig all over my desk :))
+ Drew the graphics, except the the radar display, which I ripped from the
  (evil) ZBOT - I changed that one a bit, though
Teamplay
+ Previously, most of the features that distinguished between teams (Torture
  Chamber, Proximity Mines, etc.) only worked with CTF teams - Now everything
  works with DF_SKINTEAMS and DF_MODELSTEAMS (deathmatch teamplay by skin or
  model) =)
Phaser
+ The beam now lasts for 3 seconds
Welcome message
+ No longer displayed when a menu is up (CTF menu, for example)

New to Version 1.15
-------------------
Dave Walmsley (GP)
+ Lamer (lame excuses why he *still* hasn't done the models (after 5 weeks!))
Bugfixes
+ I've fixed a few small mini-bugs here and there
CTF
+ Made the ctf cvar latched (it now says "ctf will be changed for next game"
  instead of changing it straight away) - before, if the server changed this
  cvar mid-game it would mess up a whole load of features
+ Fixed the tech powerups (bug (?) in the CTF code) so you can pick them up
  again after dropping them
HV Sniper Rifle
+ Now costs 8 slugs, not 10
Pipebomb
+ Added a new throwing model
Cluster Grenades
+ Now separate from the normal grenades from the grenade launcher
+ Drew new icon
ALLOW flags
+ Wrote all the code
+ Wrote a sample allow.cfg file
Ammo Converter
+ Wrote all the code
Deathmatch scores
+ Added a date/clock to the CTF and Deathmatch score tables
Icon
+ Created an Icon (ann.ico) - the colours may look messed up on your system (It
  uses extended colours)

Freezer
+ Raised freeze-time from 4 seconds to 5 seconds (ooh!)
Dynamic Additional Item Editing
+ Wrote _all_ the code - phew!
+ Created a sample new item layout for our favourite CTF map, Q2CTF2 :)
Airstrike
+ Reduced cost to 15 rockets
+ Added a nice new marker model
Pipebombs
+ Damage set to hand grenade damage x 2.00
+ Added a new model
Proximity Mines
+ Fixed a bug that caused "Player disarmed his/her own proximity mine(s)" to
  be displayed when 2 or more proximity mines were placed in a cluster
+ Damage set to hand grenade damage x 0.80
+ Added a new model
Phaser
+ The phaser couldn't hurt some monsters (the Big Gun boss, for example) -
  fixed it

New to Version 1.12b
--------------------
ANN Pause
+ Wrote the code
+ Added server cvar
Auto-shotgun
+ Wrote the code
+ Drew (really nice!) new icon
Freezer

  shoot any players other than the owner (heh)
+ Fixed a bug that let you could throw multiple drones if you pressed the key
  quickly enough
Fake Death
+ Fixed a bug that meant that if you tried to un-fake death then re-fake again
when actually dead, the server crashed (only Dave could find this out!)
Torture Chamber
+ Deaths are now credited properly
+ Players are no longer given 5 frags for destroying a CTF teammate's chamber
+ Fixed a bug that let you could throw multiple chambers if you pressed the key
  quickly enough

+ Now says whose chamber you destroyed
+ Tells everyone when you destroy a chamber
+ Costs 100 cells - removed "5 frags" capability
Freezer
+ Wrote the code
+ Made new model
+ Drew new icon
LaserDrone
+ Implemented the code
+ Fixed quite a few bugs
Fake Death
+ Can't fake death when frozen
Defence Lasers
+ Broke them last version with the phaser, but fixed them again :)
Technical

Name            Command     Key     Description
----            -------     ---     -----------
Ricochet Blas'r use blaster 1       The blaster will now fire shots that
                                    ricochet off surfaces, making appropriate
                                    sounds every 1 in 3 hits.
Auto-Shotgun    shotguntype 2       Toggles shotgun/auto-shotgun. The
                                    auto-shotgun fires 4 shells in sequence
                                    before reloading. Each shot is only 3/4 as
                                    powerful as a normal shotgun shot, but the
                                    kick is 4 times as much (you can make
                                    people fly away!).
Cluster Grena's glaunchtype 6       Toggles cluster grenades/flares. The
Flares                              grenade launcher now fires not only normal
                                    grenades, but cluster grenades and flares
                                    too. Cluster grenades have a smaller
                                    explosion than conventional grenades, but
                                    will break up into 4 normal grenades, each
                                    with a random damage (40+/-20), speed
                                    (10+/-3), time delay (1+/-0.3), and
                                    explosion radius (120+/-30). Flares light
                                    up the surrounding area, and can be
                                    destroyed by blowing them up, but do no
                                    damage themselves. They will automatically
                                    be disabled after 30 seconds.
                                    NB: Cluster grenades cost 2 grenades.
                                    Flares only cost 1.
Bounce Missile  rockettype  7       Cycles between rockets/bounce missiles/
Homing Missile                      homing missiles/guided missiles/nukes.
Guided Missile                      Bounce missiles will ricochet off any
Nuke                                surface they hit until they hit an entity
                                    that takes damage, when they will explode.
                                    They cost 2 rockets, and are removed after
                                    5 seconds. Homing missiles will try to
                                    home in on the first target they acquire.
                                    They will not acquire your teammates. It
                                    is best to use these for snap-shots over
                                    medium to long range. They cost 3 rockets
                                    to fire. Guided missiles cost 5 rockets,
                                    and can be guided around by moving the
                                    mouse :) They move slower than normal
                                    rockets, and you get a "rocket's- eye-view"
                                    - you see what the rocket sees! Nukes cost
                                    20 rockets, and travel at 1/2 of the speed
                                    of a rocket, but gib everyone within 1024
                                    units. BANG! When this thing hits, be
                                    somewhere else. BTW, even if you're not
                                    killed by a nuke hit up to quite a long
                                    way away, you'll be blinded for a few
                                    seconds! Note that nukes and guided rockets
                                    are vulnerable. Shoot them down before they
                                    can get to you, using any projectile or 
                                    laser-based weapon. Be warned that they are 
                                    still explosive as they circle to the 
                                    ground, but nukes will not deliver their 
                                    nuclear payload.
LaserBlaster    hyperblastertype 8  Toggles hyperblaster/laserblaster/freezer.
Freezer                             When using the laserblaster, lasers will
Disruptor Rifle                     be projected instead of bolts fired. The
                                    lasers only do 75% of the damage of
                                    hyperblaster bolts, but you do not have
                                    to wait for the bolts to travel through
                                    the air, so providing you've got a good
                                    aim, the lasers always hit. A good sniper
                                    weapon, and more net-friendly. The freezer
                                    fires ice bolts, which do 5 damage if the
                                    target has over 30% health, or freezes the
                                    target if it has 30% or less. When frozen,
                                    a player will have a blue shell and
                                    his/her/its screen will be tinted blue.
                                    A player will stay frozen for a few
                                    seconds, or until attacked. You cannot
                                    move, fire, fake death, etc. while frozen.
                                    Currently, only other multiplayer clients
                                    can be frozen, not monsters.
                                    The disruptor rifle will fire quite
                                    powerful energy discharge bolts, which are
                                    attracted to enemy players! They will
                                    bounce around off walls until a player
                                    passes within their energy field, when
                                    they will home in on the enemy and
                                    discharge into him/her/it :) Each shot
                                    costs 20 cells. The weapon fires 3 shots
                                    before it must be re-cocked.
                                    NB: The freezer fires twice as fast as the 
                                    hyperblaster, whereas the disruptor fires 
                                    much more slowly.
Sniper Rifle    railtype    9       Toggles railgun/high velocity sniper
                                    rifle. The sniper rifle is the most
                                    powerful precision weapon in the game. It
                                    delivers 500 points of damage, enough to
                                    kill any human player with all the
                                    powerups. It costs 4 slugs per shot.
Phaser          bfgtype     0       Toggles BFG10K/phaser. This costs 100
                                    cells for 3 seconds of phased energy beam
                                    that will kill any enemy by (instantly)
                                    dematerialising them on contact. Excellent. 
                                    Make sure you've got a clean shot, though, 
                                    or it'll just be a waste of cells.
Pipebombs       grenadetype g       Cycles between hand grenades/pipebombs/
Proximity Mines detpipes    d       proximity mines. Pipebombs can be thrown,
                                    then detonated later by issuing the
                                    command "detpipes". You must be within
                                    512 units of the pipebombs to detonate
                                    them, but they stick to enemies they are
                                    thrown at, or that walk over them :)
                                    Proximity mines will auto-explode when
                                    someone other than yourself or one of
                                    your team mates passes within 96 units of
                                    the mine. Pipebombs and proximity mines
                                    can be destroyed by firing at them with
                                    an explosive weapon. Pipebombs cost 3
                                    grenades and do twice as much damage as a
                                    normal hand grenade. Proximity mines cost
                                    2, and do slightly less damage. Proximity
                                    mines will stick to the surfaces they are
                                    thrown at.

----            -------     ---     -----------
Threewave CTF                       See ctfread.txt
                                    NB: I've fixed a bug in the CTF code that
                                    stopped you hurting players on other
                                    teams if they had the same skin/model as
                                    you and the server was running skin or
                                    model teamplay. Also, I've fixed it so
                                    you can pick up tech powerups again after
                                    dropping them (like normal dropped items).
Viewable Weapons                    You can now see what weapon other players
                                    are holding! This works for male, female,
                                    and cyborg models. You can download VWEP
                                    packs for other models too.
Extended HUD                        Your HUD (display) now has more
                                    information. On the left of your screen
                                    the number of cells and rockets you have
                                    is shown. This is because many features
                                    use rockets and/or cells when they are
                                    not normally being displayed. Also, the
                                    weapon you are currently using is shown.
                                    This is so that you can tell the
                                    difference between the standard Q2
                                    weapons and the ones I've added.
Cell Regenara'n                     If the ANN_ALLOW2_REGENCELLS flag (see the 
                                    Allow Flags section) is set, players will 
                                    regenerate cells at the rate of 2 every
                                    3 frames (a cell at a time), up to the
                                    limit, which depends on whether or not they
                                    have collected ammo packs, bandoliers, etc.
Kamikaze Mode   kamikaze    k       If you have 40% or more health and at
                                    least 10 rockets, issuing this command
                                    will warn everyone in the network game
                                    and start a 5 second countdown. When this
                                    time elapses, everyone within 512 units
                                    of the player will be gibbed. You cannot
                                    disable the kamikaze once activated.
Fake Death      fakedeath   f       You will throw your current weapon, tech
                                    powerup, and CTF flag, and dive as if you
                                    had just been killed. Issuing the command
                                    again will make you get back up. You can
                                    still be killed when faking death, and no
                                    obituary message will be generated when
                                    faking, so if attackers are careful they
                                    will be able to tell you're not really
                                    dead.
Sniper Zooming  zoomin      MWUP    Zooms your view in 10° until your FOV is
                                    20°. The mouse is made more sensitive.
                zoomout     MWDN    Returns to normal view, and normal mouse
                                    sensitivity.
Cloaking        cloak       c       Toggles cloaking mode on/off. When
                                    cloaking is on, after 1.5 seconds of
                                    standing still, you will cloak - become
                                    invisible to all other players. 1 cell
                                    will be drained every 8 frames. As soon as
                                    you move again you will uncloak, but you 
                                    can look around and fire when you're 
                                    cloaked. When cloaked your view will be
                                    darkened.
Cloaking Jammer jammer      r       Toggles the cloaking jammer on/off. When
                                    it is on, any cloaked players passing
                                    within 256 units of the jammer will have
                                    bright purple shells, and become visible.
                                    It costs 1 cell every 20 frames to run
                                    the jammer. If your cloaking device is
                                    being jammed, your screen will be tinted
                                    bright purple.
Teleporter      storetele   n       Stores your current location.
                loadtele    m       If you have at least 40% health and 40
                                    cells, you will be teleported to the
                                    location that was stored earlier. Anyone
                                    at the destination will be telefragged!
                                    If you die, any location stored will be
                                    erased, so there!
AntiGrav Boots  boots       b       Toggles anti-gravity boots on/off. You
                                    need at least 1 rocket to activate the
                                    boots, and every time you jump when
                                    wearing the boots 1 rocket is used. It
                                    doesn't cost any rockets to fall with
                                    the boots, though. The boots reduce the
                                    effect of gravity on you by 85%.
Bleeding                            Whenever a player has less than 40%
                                    health, he/she/it will continually bleed.
                                    Picking up health will stop the bleeding.
Defence Lasers  laser       l       Places a defence laser wall mount on the
                                    surface currently pointed at. The wall
                                    mount will project a laser the same as
                                    your CTF team colour, or yellow outside
                                    CTF mode, after 3 seconds. Lasers cost
                                    20 cells to place. Your lasers will not
                                    hurt you or your team mates. Shooting
                                    the wall mount will cause it to blow up,
                                    disabling the laser.
                                    NB: Each player can only have 5 lasers at
                                    a time. To deploy more, the old lasers
                                    must be destroyed.
BFG Suit        use bfg s't s       In item compatibility mode (see below),
                                    picking up Body Armour or Combat Armour
                                    will give you a BFG Suit to use. When
                                    item compatibility mode is disabled, you
                                    can pick up a BFG Suit, which you will have
                                    to place first (see Dynamic Item Editing,
                                    below). This can be activated by typing
                                    "use bfg suit" or selecting and activating
                                    the BFG Suit icon from the items list on
                                    your HUD. For 3 seconds you will be 
                                    surrounded by a BFG ball that will 
                                    obliterate any enemies within 512 units.
                                    Quad damage doesn't affect the damage of
                                    the BFG Suit - it's powerful enough :)
Marine Radio    radio_power         The marine radio is a cool little device
                radio               that allows you to send/receive voice
                tradio              messages in multiplayer games. These must
                pradio              be saved as wave files (.WAV) in the
                                    sound/radio directory, off the
                                    Annihilation directory. To turn the radio
                                    on/off you can set the radio_power
                                    variable.
                                    Values  are:    0 or OFF  - Radio off
                                                    1 or ON   - Radio on
                                                    2 or TEAM - Team only
                                    So, for example, typing
                                    "radio_power team" will allow you to hear
                                    official team messages only (messages
                                    broadcast to the whole of your team).
                                    To send a message to everyone who has
                                    their radio in mode 1 (ON), use
                                    "radio <sample>", where <sample> is the
                                    name of the wave file in sound/radio,
                                    without the .WAV extension. To send a
                                    team message to everyone on your team who
                                    has their radio in mode 1 (ON) or 2
                                    (TEAM), use "tradio <sample>". To send
                                    a private message to a player who has
                                    their radio in mode 1 (ON), use
                                    "pradio <player> <sample>", where player
                                    is the player's nickname. If the player
                                    has a space in their name, put the name
                                    in double-quotes.
                                    For example, "tradio attack" will send
                                    the message "All units, attack enemy
                                    base, over" to your team.
                                    All players hearing the message need to
                                    have the wave file in their sound/radio
                                    directory. The radio files that come with
                                    Annihilation are:
                                    ATTACK      - Offensive message
                                    BURNS1      - Joke message 1
                                    BURNS2      - Joke message 2
                                    DEFEND      - Defensive message
                                    DUKE1       - Duke Nukem - 1
                                    DUKE2       - Duke Nukem - 2
                                    DUKE3       - Duke Nukem - 3
                                    REORG1      - Reorg message 1
                                    REORG2      - Reorg message 2
                                    RETURN      - Return to base
                                    FACE        - Ridicule 1
                                    BRING       - Ridicule 2
                                    NB: Whenever you send a message, a text
                                    header including your name, and the name
                                    of the file being played is sent to the
                                    receiving player's screen. Also, the
                                    radio_power is initialized in the
                                    autoexec.cfg file. See "Other Notes"
                                    below for details...
Jetpack         use jetpack j       In item compatibility mode, when you pick
                                    up a quad damage, you also get a Jetpack,
                                    and 45 seconds worth of fuel. When
                                    item-compatibility is disabled, you can
                                    pick up a Jetpack, which you will need to
                                    place first (see Dynamic Item Editing,
                                    below). The Jetpack is never auto-used (in
                                    deathmatch), as it would probably be a
                                    waste when you've got quad damage. To use,
                                    type "use jetpack" or use it like any other
                                    item by selecting it's icon and activating
                                    it. You move around as normal - where you
                                    look is where you go. You can also use the
                                    jump/crouch controls to m/down. Oh,
                                    yes, don't try to go swimming with this on.
Airstrike       airstrike   a       Now you can call an airstrike in to help
                                    you. If you've got 15 rockets, aim at
                                    your target and issue the command. A
                                    red and green stripy marker thing will be
                                    placed to show your target, and you will
                                    hear radio messages from the squadron.
                                    The ETA will be announced (5..9 seconds).
                                    After this time has elapsed, 10 rockets
                                    will be fired down at the target from the
                                    air, each with an angle of +/-0.25°,
                                    damage 400+/-50, speed 200+/-50, and
                                    damage radius 300+/-100. You can cancel
                                    the airstrike at any time before the
                                    payload delivery by re-issuing the
                                    command.
                                    NB: You can only call an airstrike if
                                    there is sky above the target. It won't
                                    work indoors :)
LaserDrone      drone       e       Issuing this command will cause a
                                    LaserDrone defence robot to be spawned.
                                    After 5 seconds the robot will be armed,
                                    so RUN! It will fire high-energy lasers at
                                    anyone it sees, so use it carefully. It
                                    takes no account of team (that'd be too
                                    easy), so it's probably not any good for
                                    in-base defence. The robots have 200
                                    health. Killing one will give you 5 frags! 
                                    LaserDrones self-destruct after 60 seconds. 
                                    In single player LaserDrones will only 
                                    target monsters, not the owner, but it will
                                    always fire at other players, other 
                                    LaserDrones, guided missiles, nukes, etc, so 
                                    they can be very useful as base defense or 
                                    early warning systems, providing you don't 
                                    get too close to hem yourself :)
Bounce Physics                      Improved bounce physics has been added!
                                    This stops bouncing entities from sticking
                                    on sloping surfaces. Find a slope (just
                                    outside the bases in Q2CTF1, for example)
                                    and chuck a grenade/pipebomb/proximity
                                    mine on it. Watch it roll! Cool or what?
                                    This opens up a whole new set of ideas for
                                    maps (waste-disposal for grenades? :) ).
Torture Chamber chamber     z       When you issue this command, if you have
                                    200 cells, you will throw a torture
                                    chamber, which will, when it has come to
                                    rest, activate with a large laser down it's
                                    middle, the same colour as your CTF team,
                                    or green outside CTF mode. Any enemy
                                    players passing within 512 units of the top
                                    of the chamber will be teleported into the
                                    chamber and tortured to death! After 2
                                    minutes, or if the owner re-issues the
                                    command, the chamber will self-destruct. If
                                    the pipe at the top of the chamber is
                                    damaged enough (200 health) the chamber
                                    will be destroyed and the attacker will get
                                    the number of frags that the chamber has 
                                    accumulated (providing (s)he doesn't own
                                    the chamber), but don't get too close :)
ANN Pause       annpause    PAUSE   Issuing the annpause command (pressing the
                                    pause key by default) will pause the game
                                    as normal in single-player mode, or use new
                                    code to pause the game in deathmatch,
                                    saying who paused the game. This feature is
                                    enabled by default. To disable it, see

Item Compat.                        When the console variable "itemcompat" is 1,
                                    picking up Quad Damage will also give you a
                                    Jetpack, and picking up any suit-armour will
                                    give you a BFG Suit. This is for use on
                                    maps where you want to use these items, but
                                    haven't placed an item_jetpack or
                                    item_bfg_armor, either in your map editor,
                                    or using the item editing commands, below.
                                    It is set to 0 by default. See "Other
                                    Notes" below for more info.
Ammo Converter  convert             The command
                                    "convert <from|"off"|"0"> [<to>]"
                                    where from or to are 2 of:
                                    shells,     bullets,    grenades,
                                    rockets,    cells,      slugs.
                                    Ammunition will be converted from <from> to
                                    <to>. Each ammo type is worth a certain
                                    amount against the other types, as follows:
                                    shells      1       
                                    bullets     3       So, for example, you
                                    grenades    8       must trade 8 shells for
                                    rockets     13      1 grenade, or 3 rockets
                                    cells       4       for 13 bullets.
                                    slugs       16
                                    To change to a different conversion, just
                                    re-issue the command with the new
                                    parameters. Use a single argument, "off"
                                    (or "0") to stop the conversion.
                                    Examples:
                                    convert rockets slugs
                                    convert off
Time            time        i       Displays the current time and date :)
Players/Who SvC sv who              Typing "sv who" or "sv players" from the
                                    server console will perform the same as
                                    the normal "players" command, except that
                                    additional information will be displayed,
                                    such as userid and IP address. These can
                                    be used for kicking/banning.
BOT Detection                       For those of you that don't know, bots
                                    are really lame client proxys that on the                                    
                                    command of the player, automatically aim
                                    and fire, hitting the enemy every time
                                    with trace weapons (weapons using shells,
                                    bullets, and slugs, as well as special
                                    extras like the phaser, etc.). They can
                                    turn round and take perfect aim instantly.
                                    With the ZBOT the player also gets a free
                                    radar showing the positions of all other
                                    players on the server. LAME! The
                                    "botdetect" cvar will allow you to keep
                                    these scum out of your games. Set this
                                    variable in the usual way (like dmflags and
                                    ann_allow* - see below).

                                    Possible settings are:
                                    BOT_LOG         1
                                        Logs all players using bots to a file
                                        called "botdetect.log" in the ann
                                        directory.
                                    BOT_KICK        2
                                        Automatically kicks clients using bots
                                        off the server.
                                    BOT_NOTIFY      4
                                        Warns everyone on the server of clients
                                        using bots, not just the server
                                        console.
                                    BOT_IMPULSE     8
                                        Listens for ZBOT impulses. (The ZBOT is
                                        one of the major auto-aim bots). This
                                        will allow ZBOT clients to be detected
                                        as soon as they activate their bot.

                                    The default setting is 15 (all flags
                                    enabled).

                                    When bots are found, their IP address
                                    is reported. The server admin can choose
                                    whether or not to ban the client.
Radar           radar       h       Enables/disables the radar display. This
                radarzoomin <       is quite a cool device that will let you
                radarzoomout>       see monsters and other players on the map.
                                    In single player games, you should only
                                    see yellow dots on the radar - the
                                    monsters. In co-op, you'll see green dots
                                    too - your allies. In CTF the dots are the
                                    same as the player's team colour. In
                                    deathmatch teamplay games your team is
                                    green and all enemies are yellow. The
                                    "radarzoomin" and "radarzoomout" commands
                                    zoom the radar's display in and out
                                    respectively. The current radar zoom
                                    (scan range in Quake units) is shown to
                                    the bottom-right of the central radar
                                    display. The radar costs 1 cell every 3 
                                    frames to use, so you can't afford to have 
                                    it up all the time.
                                    NB: If the ANN_ALLOW2_RADARHIDECLOAKERS
                                    flag is set (see ALLOW FLAGS, below),
                                    cloaked players will not show up on the
                                    radar display.
Laser Sight     sight       ;       You now get a laser sight (at last :))!
Flashlight                          Issuing the command for the first time
                                    will activate the laser sight. Doing
                                    this a second time will activate the
                                    flashlight, providing you have some cells
                                    - the flashlight costs 1 cell every 2
                                    seconds. It's not expensive, but not to
                                    be wasted. The flashlight will (obviously)
                                    light up the area, as well as providing a
                                    laser sight. The laser sight will turn red
                                    (from green) if you target an enemy - wait
                                    for that dot!
IR Goggles      goggles     o       Very useful for finding players hiding in
                                    the shadows, the IR Goggles will
                                    illuminate other players and monsters to
                                    you, providing you've got 2 cells a second!
Respawn Protec'                     This is yet another anti-lamer feature :)
                                    Ever seen those lamers, especially on
                                    infinite-ammo servers, constantly firing
                                    at spawn points? That sucks... If the
                                    server sets the respawn_protect console
                                    variable to the number of server frames
                                    to give protection for (10 times the
                                    number of seconds) then all respawners
                                    will be protected for that amount of time.
                                    For example:
                                    respawn_protect 25
                                    ... gives 2 and a half seconds of
                                    protection to each player. The default is
                                    3 seconds of protection. Setting this
                                    variable to 0 will disable respawn
                                    protection.
MemoServ			    MemoServ allows server admins to display
				    predefined messages to players as they
				    enter the game. Create a file in the the
				    ann directory called "memos.txt", and put
				    the messages you want to display as lines
				    in the file. There is no upper limit, but
				    your messages should be short, and you
				    should usually have only 1 line of text.
				    Experiment :)

MULTIPLAYER SCHEMES
I've added a few aliases to set the ann_allow and ann_allow2 flags (see below) 
according to a particluar theme. The following schemes are available:

scheme_carnage      Everything allowed! The default.
scheme_the_force    Cell-based, futuristic weaponry and abilities.
scheme_armageddon   Heavy explosives, and other weapons of mass destruction!
scheme_snipers      A game of aim and skill, sniper-based weapons, zooming, etc.
scheme_trappers     How many powerups can you rig?!
scheme_recon        Medium-infantry, you'll get an all-round set.
scheme_psychotics   You left your mind back at the institute - kill, kill, kill!

To switch to another scheme, just type the scheme name in the console, for 
example: scheme_recon

To see exactly what features are enabled/disabled in each theme, examing the 
"schemes.cfg" file in any text editor.

You can switch schemes mid-game, but be warned that changed to weapons will not 
take place until the players change their weapon. There are a few other similar 
restrictions. Again, see the "Allow Flags" section below for more details.

MAP ROTATION
This cool new set of server commands allows the running of a maplist script for
map rotation. When enabled, if the timelimit, fraglimit, or capturelimit is
hit, the server will automatically advance to the next map on the list, or a
random one if that option is enabled.

The variables are:
Variable        Possible values     Number      Default
--------        ---------------     ------      -------
rotate          off                 0           0
                MR_SEQUENTIAL       1
                MR_RANDOM           2
rotate_filename Any mapscript filename          maplist.rot

The server commands are:
Command                 Explanation
-------                 -----------
sv firstmap             Reloads the first map on the list.
sv nextmap              Immediately skips to the next map on the list.
sv listmaps             Lists all the maps on the list, in order.
sv reloadmaplist        Reloads the maplist (if you've modified it, for
                        example).

rotate_filename specifies the name of the maplist file. Default is
"maplist.rot".

rotate specifies the rotation type - 0 is off, 1 is sequential rotation, 2 is
random rotation.

If you change the maplist you need to either restart the server, or type "sv
reloadmaplist" at the server console (or using rcon :)).

The "sv listmaps" command displays a number (0 or 1) to the left of each map.
This specifies if the map has been used yet. This flag is used when Map
Rotation is set to random (2), and ensures that every map is played before
the cycle restarts.

Quake 2 can only accept commands and server commands when the map has been
loaded, so just load any map, then just play out that level and let the
rotation kick in when the time/frag/capture limit is hit.

NB: If the DF_SAME_LEVEL deathmatch flag is set, IT WILL OVERRIDE MAP ROTATION!
Make sure this dmflag is reset (turned off) if you're using map rotation!

NB: There must be players on the server for the map to rotate, as the
intermission screen will be started for all clients in the same way as a
time/frag/capture limit hit.

The format of the script file is really simple: Just a list of the map
filenames, without the path or .map extension, each on its own line. You can
use # for comments if you want. See maplist.rot for an example.

DYNAMIC ADDITIONAL ITEM EDITING:
Note that all item editing commands are only available in single player mode.
To set up new items for a level in multiplayer, load the map in single player,
edit the items using the following commands, save the configuration, and when
the map is loaded in multiplayer (deathmatch or co-op) the items will appear
properly and will be collectable.

Place an Item   placeitem           Issue this command with the classname of
                                    an item as it's argument to place that
                                    item at your current position, for
                                    example: placeitem item_quad
                                    Will place a Quad Damage. The item will
                                    appear surrounded by a red shell to
                                    distinguish it from the normal items :)
Remove items    clearitems          Removes all new items you've added to the
                                    map.
Undo last item  undoitem            Removes the last item that was added. You
                                    can use it repeatedly to sequentially
                                    remove all new items.
Item eraser     eraseitems          This command toggles the item-eraser mode
                                    on/off. When this mode is on, you can
                                    simply walk over new items to remove them.
                                    Remember to turn the eraser off when
                                    placing new items, though :)
List new items  listitems           Lists all new items and their coordinates,
                                    starting with the most recent.
Save config.    saveitems           MAKE SURE YOU ISSUE THIS COMMAND BEFORE
                                    EXITING THE LEVEL if you want to keep any
                                    changes to the new item configuration.
                                    This command will create a data file in
                                    the config directory containing the
                                    coordinates and classnames of all new
                                    items, which will be automatically loaded
                                    whenever that map is loaded in
                                    multiplayer.
                                    
At any time, to re-edit the configuration, just re-load the map in single
player, make the changes, and save the configuration again. NB: Only the
server needs to have the config/mapname.ann file (containing the new item
details).

ALLOW FLAGS:
Almost every feature of Annihilation, and many of the normal Quake 2 features,
can be enabled or disabled in the allow.cfg file, or during the game. The 2
console variables you need to know are ann_allow and ann_allow2. These
variables should contain 24-bit binary numbers (in the same way as the
dmflags variable), each bit referring to a particular feature. There are more
than 24 features that can be switched, though, so 2 variables were used. More
may be introduced as more features can be toggled.

NOTE: FragAngeL made a cool program (ANNSettings.exe) to automatically set
these flags, and bot detection flags, based on your input. It has a nice GUI
so you'll probably want to use it instead of doing all the stuff below:

You should add together the values of the features you want to enable, and
set ann_allow and ann_allow2 to these totals. Below is a list of the values
corresponding to the supported features:

ANN_ALLOW_RICOCHETBLASTER          1 | ANN_ALLOW2_PAUSE                   1
ANN_ALLOW_SHOTGUN                  2 | ANN_ALLOW2_KAMIKAZE                2
ANN_ALLOW_AUTOSHOTGUN              4 | ANN_ALLOW2_FAKEDEATH               4
ANN_ALLOW_SUPERSHOTGUN             8 | ANN_ALLOW2_CLOAKING                8
ANN_ALLOW_MACHINEGUN              16 | ANN_ALLOW2_CLOAKINGJAMMER         16
ANN_ALLOW_CHAINGUN                32 | ANN_ALLOW2_TELEPORTER             32
ANN_ALLOW_GRENADELAUNCHER         64 | ANN_ALLOW2_ANTIGRAVBOOTS          64
ANN_ALLOW_CLUSTERGRENADE         128 | ANN_ALLOW2_DEFENCELASER          128
ANN_ALLOW_FLARE                  256 | ANN_ALLOW2_AIRSTRIKE             256
ANN_ALLOW_ROCKETLAUNCHER         512 | ANN_ALLOW2_LASERDRONE            512
ANN_ALLOW_BOUNCEMISSILE         1024 | ANN_ALLOW2_TORTURECHAMBER       1024
ANN_ALLOW_HOMINGMISSILE         2048 | ANN_ALLOW2_CONVERT              2048
ANN_ALLOW_GUIDEDMISSILE         4096 | ANN_ALLOW2_RADAR                4096
ANN_ALLOW_NUKE                  8192 | ANN_ALLOW2_DISRUPTOR            8192
ANN_ALLOW_HYPERBLASTER         16384 | ANN_ALLOW2_FLASHLIGHT          16384
ANN_ALLOW_LASERBLASTER         32768 | ANN_ALLOW2_IRGOGGLES           32768
ANN_ALLOW_FREEZER              65536 | ANN_ALLOW2_RADARHIDECLOAKERS   65536
ANN_ALLOW_RAILGUN             131072 | ANN_ALLOW2_LIGHTSABER         131072
ANN_ALLOW_SNIPERRIFLE         262144 | ANN_ALLOW2_REGENCELLS         262144
ANN_ALLOW_BFG10K              524288 |                               ------
ANN_ALLOW_PHASER             1048576 | ANN_ALLOW2 TOTAL              524287
ANN_ALLOW_HANDGRENADE        2097152 | 
ANN_ALLOW_PIPEBOMB           4194304 | 
ANN_ALLOW_PROXIMITYMINE      8388608 | 
                            -------- | 
ANN_ALLOW TOTAL             16777215 | 

So, to enable all the features (default) these lines should appear in
allow.cfg:

set ann_allow     16777215 s
set ann_allow2    131071 s

Remember, to disable features, just add up all the features you want (or
subtract the ones you don't want from the totals) and set the flags to those
numbers as above.

Examples:
Laserblaster-only battle:              ann_allow: 32768,    ann_allow2: 2049
No defence lasers, pausing, or radars: ann_allow: 16777215, ann_allow2: 61310

NB: A quick way to enable all features is to just set ann_allow and ann_allow2
to -1. This has the effect of causing all bits being set to 1 when the number
is converted to binary, therefore enabling all the features :)

You can change these mid-game, but you'll probably want to initialize them in
the allow.cfg file.

NB: Changing the values mid-game will cause those changes to take effect
immediately, but some items (weapons, cloaking, ammo converter, etc.) will
continue to work until that user deactivates the item, or changes the weapon.

6. AnnPlay
----------
AnnPlay is a program that provides an interface between Quake 2 and Winamp, the
popular audio player. It lets you control the Winamp player from the Quake 2
client, allowing you to play MP3s, MIDIs, MODs, S3Ms, RAs, etc. while you're
fragging! You can even play live Internet SHOUTcast audio streams!

WARNING: You need a fairly high-end system to run Winamp alongside Quake 2,
especially if you're going to play MP3s. I've seen it running OK on a 32Mb
P200 and there's absolutely no slowdown on my K6-2/350. You can always give it
a go on your system, and see how playable it is.

NB: You must have at least version 2.00 of Winamp to use AnnPlay. Visit
http://www.winamp.com to get the latest version :)

Before you use Annplay, load Winamp and verify the following settings:
+ Auto-load visualisation plugin on play is disabled
+ Output plugin is WaveOut (or possibly CrossFading), NOT DirectSound

Also, make up a playlist, and save it as annplay.m3u in the ann directory. This
is the default playlist, that will be loaded when Annihilation starts. You may
also have other playlists, that can be loaded from within the game. These
playlists must have short filenames (maximum of 8 characters, plus the ".m3u"),
although this does not apply to the files in the playlists.

To start Annihilation with AnnPlay enabled, run the annplay.exe file
in the ann directory. If it's your first time running AnnPlay you will be asked
to locate your winamp.exe (usually located in C:\Program Files\Winamp).

Winamp will be started (if not already) and the default playlist, annplay.m3u ,
will be loaded. Annihilation will then start and the following AnnPlay commands
will be initialised:

Command         Function
-------         --------
ap_toggle       Play/stop toggle
ap_play         Play
ap_stop         Stop
ap_pause        Pause
ap_next         Next song
ap_prev         Previous song
ap_volup        Volume up
ap_voldn        Volume down
ap_rew          Rewind 5 seconds
ap_ffw          Fast-forward 5 seconds
ap_file         Load another playlist
ap_cue          Cue the playlist specified by ap_file

The ap_file variable can specify a playlist, or song (which must have a short
filename, and be in the ann directory - a limitation of Quake 2). After setting
this variable you should type ap_cue to load the new playlist. If a song is
playing when you ype it, it will continue to play until you use ap_play or
change the track.

So, to start playing songs from the shady.m3u playlist you would type:
ap_file shady.m3u
ap_cue
ap_play         <-- If you want to start the song instantly

Annihilation comes with the PGDN key bound to ap_toggle - press that key to
start and stop the music :)

Remember, playlists can contain (almost) anything: MP3s, MIDIs, MODs, S3Ms,
RAs, SHOUTcast stream URLs, a link to your microphone, anything :)

7. Other Notes
--------------
The "autosay" feature has been disabled. You know, if you go into the console
and make a typo in a command it is sent to everyone on the server. LAME! Now,
to send a message, use the messagemode or say command.

The toggle/cycle weapon commands all also accept an argument - the weapon
number (0, 1, etc.). For example, "rockettype 1" will select homing missiles
instantly.

When a client connects, his/her IP address will be revealed to the server, in
the form "Player @ foo.bar.com connected", rather than the traditional
"Player connected".

You can issue the "welcome" command to display a start-up message. It's
normally displayed when starting a new map, but this command will do it too.

CTF mode is disabled by default. To enable it, type "set ctf 1" at the
console, or if you always play CTF you can edit the autoexec.cfg file, take
out the "//"s in front of the required line, and add "//" where necessary.
See the Quake2 technical documentation for more information.

IMPORTANT: IF NOT PLAYING CTF, MAKE SURE CTF MODE IS DISABLED, OR YOU WILL BE
FORCED TO JOIN CTF TEAMS!

You can also set the "radio_power" and "itemcompat" variables in the autoexec
file, as above.

When Annihilation is started, demos are played by default. After you've watched 
them a few times you may be fed up with them, so there is a way to disable
them. Edit your autoexec.cfg and find the line near the end that says "dem1".
Add a "//" to the front of this line, as above, to disable demos on startup. If
after doing this Annihilation appears to stick on a blank screen when you run
it, just tap the ~ key (above TAB, left of 1) to toggle the console. Then press
ESC to activate the menu.

The following additional variables have been given archive status - they will
be stored and their values maintained between sessions in Quake 2:

itemcompat   | maxentities  | ctf
radio_power  | dmflags      | botdetect
ann_allow    | fraglimit    | respawn_protect
ann_allow2   | timelimit    | rotate
maxclients   | capturelimit | rotate_filename

I've also changed the console background to make it more interesting, and
modified the console font :)

8. New Deathmatch Flags
-----------------------

I've added a new deathmatch flag. If you don't know how to use deathmatch
flags, you probably don't need to, but you can see the Quake 2 manual and/or
ctfread.txt for more info.

DF_ANN_CTF_BASESTART       1048576
    Players will always respawn in their base. Normally, this will only
    happen when a player enters the game. After dying, the player will start
    at a random deathmatch spawn point.

9. Default Control Configuration
--------------------------------
I've listed Annihilation's default keyboard/mouse configuration. To change
these keys, just use the ingame menus like normal. To restore the default
config at any time, bring down the console and type "exec annkeys.cfg", or
just select "reset defaults" from the Options menu to reset the entire
configuration.

OK, here are the keys...

    TAB             Inventory

11. New Annihilation Maps
------------
The extra maps provided with Annihilation are:
Type    Filename            Descriptive name                    Mapper
----    --------            ----------------                    ------

CTF     maps/annctf4.bsp    Shopping in the Dark                FOX HQ

To install other new maps, just copy the BSP file into the MAPS directory off
the Annihilation directory. To run the map in the game, set the deathmatch and
ctf variables according to the map's specification (i.e. "deathmatch 1; ctf 0"
for a deathmatch, non-CTF map), then type "map <mapname>" where <mapname> is
the filename of the map without the .BSP extension.

12. Help/Recommendations/Bug Reports
------------------------------------
If you have a recommendation for a future release of this mod, please let me
know and I'll try to implement it if it's worth adding. If you find a bug,
please let me know ASAP, and I'll try to fix it before the next release. If
you're having trouble installing or running Annihilation, make sure you've
read the "Installation" section thoroughly, and referred to the Quake 2 manual
if necessary. If you're still having difficulties, mail me at
ann@telefragged.com quoting the version of Annihilation you're using,
and I'll see what I can do :)

13. Credits and Modifications
