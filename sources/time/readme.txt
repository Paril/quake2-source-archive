*Brief Description*
(if a mod can't be described in a paragraph, it's not worth playing ;)
							
Each player starts out with a 45 second timelimit. This appears under 
your frags on the right.  Once the timer reaches zero, the player 
explodes (killing anyone nearby). Fragging other players increases 
your time. Also, you get bonus points for staying alive longer. These
increase exponentially, the more people you kill. The mod is totally 
server side, no new models or sounds to download.

Hint: Quad also affects the the explosion damage when you explode :)

*Installation*

Just make sure the .dll gets installed to the quake2/countdn directory. 
Note that only servers need the dll.

*Server Variables (the defaults should work fine for these)*:

lifetime - How long you have to live when you start
fragbonus - How much time you get from fragging someone

It's recommended that you run with a fraglimit or a timelimit too.

*Interesting tid-bit*

This mod was concieved and coded in 3-4 hours. It was also released
later the same day.
