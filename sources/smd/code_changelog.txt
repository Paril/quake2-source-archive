Here's a list of changes I've made to the Lazarus code base...
 -- Musashi


- Tank commanders fall apart when they die (tank_commander_body generated).
- New monster type: [monster_sentrybot].
- Infantry guards can fire hyperblasters (spawnflag: SPECIAL).
- Infantry guards can dodge by rolling left/right.
- Infantry guards have a fountain of blood when they lose their head (death anim).
- Light Soldiers can fire super-blaster bolts (spawnflag: SPECIAL).
- Flyers can fire super-blaster bolts (spawnflag: SPECIAL).
- Technicians can fire super-blaster bolts (spawnflag: SPECIAL).
- Technicians can dodge by quickly moving sideways.
- Icari can fire rockets (spawnflag: SPECIAL).
- Icari alternate shots between their shoulder mounts.
- Icari can dodge by quickly moving sideways.
- Brains can fire plasma bolts (spawnflag: SPECIAL).
- Brains can use Parasite-like attacks; hooked players are reeled in for gutting!
- Beserkers don't pause before swinging if skill > EASY.
- Tanks fire rockets sooner after activating their launcher.
- Tanks follow their target when spraying their MG.
- Tank Commanders break apart upon death (rather than gibbing), and spawn the head/key model.
- Chicks can dodge using high backflips.
- Increased damage for Beserkers (club and swing attacks).
- Increased damage to 2 for Flyers.
- Increased damage to 3 for Floaters.
- Increased damage to 4 for Icari and Medics.
- Monsters learn to not bother ducking if it hasn't stopped them getting hurt.
- Monsters' ducking time depends on ETA of projectile.
- Monsters don't duck if they'd be vulnerable for too long.
- Monsters don't duck if they're currently firing (or about to fire) a weapon.
- Monsters preferentially use homing rockets (if flagged) compared to other ranged weapons.
- Monsters lead their target when firing (accuracy is dependent upon skill level and target velocity).
- Probability of monsters reattacking is proportional to skill level.
- Increase default 'gib_health' for lighter monsters.
- Add 'nohint' spawnflag (64) for monsters.
- Reduce default 'flies' probability on [monster_*] entities.
- Add 'powerscreen' field to [monster_*] entities.
- No pain anims below a certain amount of damage (eg. <= 6); depends on the 
  specific monster.
- Fixed incorrect CG muzzle flash on Supertank.
- Chicks and Infantry guards use their special dodges against rockets, if at the right range for it.
- Infantry guards use their roll-dodges against non-distant MG fire.

- Increased falling damage.
- Automatically turn off crosshair and HUD info when using a [target_monitor].
- Health does not decrease after picking up the MH.
- Extended soundlist & user-specified WAV files for [trigger_single], [_multiple] and [_relay].
- Light and heavy start/mid/end sounds played internally by [func_plat]s.
- Light and heavy start/mid/end sounds played internally by [func_door_*]s.
- Start/mid/end sounds played internally by [func_train]s.
- Brush content flag that allows bullets/bolts but stops rockets/grenades (for grills).
- Blaster and plasma bolts bounce off [func_force_wall] surfaces.
- Add 'killtarget' key to items/keys/etc.
- New [trigger_medibot] entity.
- New [key_hipower_cube] entity.
- New [target_holo] entity.
- New [item_hackedpass] entity.
- New [target_bubbles] entity.
- New [func_air] entity.
- New [trigger_command] entity.
- New [func_clock_screen] entity.
- New [target_viewshake] entity.
- [trigger_relay_toggle] to toggle between two delay/message/target key values.
- [func_button] to toggle between two delay/message/target key values.
- [trigger_multiple] to toggle between two delay/message/target key values.
- [func_door*] entities shouldn't damage player when dmg = 0.
- Allow [model_turrets] to be remotely fired (just like [turret_breaches] can be).
- Fix [trigger_key] so 'key_message' is displayed if set.
- Stop [key_pass] rotating when dropped by a monster.
- Only fire an [item_*]'s targets if it is actually picked up (not just touched).
- Spawnflag added for [func_force_wall]s to reflect energy bolts. 
- Ability for entities spawned by [target_fountain]s to be animated.
- Ability for turrets to be double-barrelled (alternate and simultaneous fire modes).
- Teleporter destinations can be flagged to have no model.
- [key_commanders_head] is indestructable to crushing damage (non-crusher doors).
- Spawnflag added for [func_force_wall]s to play "bzzz" sound when hit.
- Fixed crashes with target_monitor (resulting from self->enemy being NULL).
- Added spawngflag 32 to misc_teleporter (can have (no) effects OR (no) model).
- Fixed bug where middle sounds of doors weren't played (requires info_notnull in map).
