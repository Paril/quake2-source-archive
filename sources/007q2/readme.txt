007 Quake 2



--<<!||YOU GOTTA READ THIS||!>>--
Ok, here are things you need to know when playing 007Q2.
First, to use zooming, you need to bind a key to +zoom. This can be done by
pressing ~ on your keyboard during the game, and typing:
bind ALT +zoom
(where ALT is could be a or b or c)
If you want to use Remote Mines, you must have +set g_gametype 1
in the command line when you start 007Q2.
To detonate Remote Mines, you need to bind another key to:
detonate

To spawn bots, you need to bring down the console (pressing ~)
and type:
sv addbot (put the # you want of them here)
eg. sv addbot 4
That will spawn four bots. 

Also if you have OpenGL enabled, fog should appear. If your video card supports
OpenGL but not fog (ie. you have weird stuff happening, and no fog) then set fog to
0 in the config.cfg located in the 007Q2 folder. 
To use thirdperson mode, type "thirdperson" (excluding the quotes) in the console,
and to revert from that mode type "thirdperson" again.
