ACEBOT II BASE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  I decided to release the base code for ACEBOT II for further study.
Hopefully it will provide a simple base on which to build future bots.
I think I have solved most of the basic problems associated with bots and
by using this source as a starting point, much more advanced bots can be
created. My time now is quite limited and I am not sure what I will be
doing with this source in the future. I do have plans for some interesting
"additions" to this bot, but time may not make it possible for these
to be realized. 

  A number of the basic routines have been "dumbed" down from the 
original ACE sourcecode and some are only put there just to make the bot
function. Even so, it still plays a pretty good game.

  I hope my comments in the source code are easy enough to read and I will
answer questions about the source as long as they are well thought out. I
will not respond to stupid or obvious questions. So if you are new to
C, I ain't gonna spend my time teaching you the basics. I've also 
simplified my C usage and some routines are written for readability vs. 
performance. 

  If you wish to add to the base code and think others would benifit from
your addition, please email me and we can discuss it.
  
  All code was written and compiled using MS Visual C++ 6.0+SP1. To install
the source, create a directory named "ace" under <drive>:\quake2 (c:\quake2\ace).
Unzip the source to \quake2\ace and it will create a src directory for the
source code and a \quake2\nav directory for the node files.

  I would also like to see the work that others create using this base.
So if you create the next "killer" mod, please let me know about it.

  Good luck and happy coding!
