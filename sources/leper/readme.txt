shoot limbs off, THEN shoot the guys dead for bonus points.
if you shoot ALL the limbs off, then shoot the guy dead you get
a bonus "quadraplegic" point. The maximum score u can get off 1 guy
is 6 (1 for the kill, 4 for the limbs, 1 for the quad bonus).

quad does 1 damage but 40x kick. it also turns anyone it is used on into a 
quadraplegic (ie. no limbs)

If you only have 1 leg you will have to hop to get around.
If you have no legs u will crawl slowly. while you have no legs
if you hold your jump button you will be able to use a grapple hook.
Just point at the place you want to go, hold jump and a grapple hook
will shoot out to whereever you want. it will then pull you into the
the place where it hits a wall. grappling people will do them no damage
and you will not be pulled towards them.

Grapple is not available when you have legs.

you can pick up limb by walking over health packs or by walking over a limb 
that you need.

if you do not need the limb type you are walking over (arm/leg)
you will kick/throw the limb in the direction you are facing.

losing 1 arm results in loss of accuracy of weapons. Losing both
means you will not be able to use weapons. instead you can use teeth.
biting someone (press your attack button while facing them) will do 
50 damage to them and if they have a limb that you do not have, you 
will steal their limb. ie, you have no arms, they have 2, you take 1 
of their arms. biting is a very rapid fire weapon. hold fire down for best
results.

the first person to be killed on a level will drop "the golden Leg".
The golden leg gives you 1 point for every 5 seconds you own it but you
must be moving to get the point(to stop camping). whiel you have the golden
limb you will eminate a golden glow and leave a trail of yellowfariy 
dust behind u. you will not be able to see this tell tail sign but 
everyone else will. if either of your legs is shot off, you 
will lose the golden limb. if you die while having the golden limb,
you will drop the golden limb. if you disconnect while u have the golden limb
the golden limb will be dropped.  when detached from a body, the golden limb will
jump around the level randomly. if the golden limb is somehow lost on the level-
tough. keep fragging.

you can create hybrid player models

usually if your model is male your gender is male.
if your model is female your gender is female.
if your model is cyborg your gender is neutral.
try choosing between these models and also using the command
"gender <sex>" where sex is male, femal or neutral.

for instance, pick the female player model and type
"gender neutral" and you become a trannie. (you will have
the body of a woman and the arms of a cyborg)

chop and change to see which best suits your sexuality.

if u SERIOUSLY fuck up the models, i recommend re-installing over quake2 
(don't delete quake 2 first) especially if u don't know what you're doing.


Special Commands
----------------
goldenlimb 1/0 turn golden leg bonus on/off.
killleg - throw 1 of your legs.
killarm - throw 1 of your arms.

Grapple Tip
-----------

bind mwheeldown killleg
pull down rapidly on the mouse wheel 2 clicks and immediately hold jump.
you will grapple (you have no legs) but in mid flight you will pick your legs up.
you will be cataoulted up any surface
(see demo - type demomap demo1.dm2 in the console.).

Plans
-----
head gets knocked off and u have to control ur
body from the pov of your head.

the source code has been released.

if someone would like to continue the development of the mod, please tell me
and i will hand over the rights to them. i was thinking about having four 
special limb on the level, like the golden limb, but giving u heath, speed, damge
and sheilding powerups (like techs or runes) rather than the golden limb's point
bonus. it would be possible to own all of the rune legs at once but each could be
shot off. this s what i would have done if i could be bothered to put any more work
into this.

Support
-------
Bug reports? Suggestions? Queries? Tech help?
No no no no. there is NONE of the above until new management.
