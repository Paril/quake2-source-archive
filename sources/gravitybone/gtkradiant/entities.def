/*QUAKED target_fog (1 0 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) StartOn Toggle TurnOff
Turns a brush into fog. You can define your own fog values, using the linear settings. Or, choose one of the exp values. 

The difference between "fog_density" and "density" is dependent on the "angle" key. So you can have a thick fog in one direction and a light fog in the other. So, if "angle" is set to 90, the player will see the thick fog facing in that direction and the light fog in the opposite.

"angle" 0-360 Determines the polar values between "fog_density" and "density"
"angles" Determines a pitch/roll/yaw of the fog.
"fog_color" Specify an RGB value
"fog_model" Choices are:
   0 :Linear (Default)

/*QUAKED model_spawn (1 0 0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4) x Toggle x Player NoModel AnimOnce
A MapPack model spawner. See Lazarus website for more info.

Spawnflags:
TOGGLE: Start active, when triggered become inactive 
PLAYER: Set this if you want to use a player model. If usermodel is blank, model_spawn will use the model of the player. Otherwise the model found at players/<usermodel>/tris.md2 will be used. Note that if you specify a player model using usermodel, it must be a model that has been modified as described in the ActorPak documentation, or the model will not be skinned.
NOMODEL: Don't use a model. Useful for placing particle effects and dynamic lights.
ANIMONCE: Cycles through the animation once and then stops. Useful for lightning effects.   
---------------------
Key/Value pairs:
"style" Specifies the animation type to use.
   0: None (unless startframe and framenumbers are used)
   1: ANIM01 - cycle between frames 0 and 1 at 2 hz
   2: ANIM23 - cycle between frames 2 and 3 at 2 hz
   3: ANIM_ALL - cycle through all frames at 2 hz
   4: ANIM_ALLFAST - cycle through all frames at 10 hz

Note: The animation flags override startframe and framenumbers settings you may have enterered. ANIM_ALL and ANIM_ALLFAST don't do what you might think - rather than setting a framerate, these apparently cause the model to cycle through its ENTIRE sequence of animations in 0.5 or 0.1 seconds... which for monster and player models is of course not possible. Looks exceptionally goofy. 

"usermodel" The model to load ("models/" will be tacked on to the front, or if PLAYER is set, "players/" will be tacked on to the front and "/tris.md2" to the end). 
"startframe" The starting frame : default 0 
"framenumbers" The number of frames you want to display after startframe 
"health" If non-zero and solidstate is 3 or 4 (solid), the entity will be shootable. When destroyed, it blows up with a no-damage explosion. 
"solidstate" 
   1 - not solid at all. These models do not obey any sort of physics. If you place them up in the air or embedded in a wall they will stay there and be perfectly happy about it. 
   2 - solid. These models will "droptofloor" when spawned. If the health value is set they may be damaged. 
   3 - solid. Same as above but not affected by gravity. Model will remain in the same location. 
   4 - not solid but affected by gravity. Model will "droptofloor" when spawned. 
NOTE : if you want the model to be solid and/or drop to the floor then you must enter vector values into the following fields: 
"bleft" the point that is at the bottom left of the models bounding box in a model editor 
"tright" the point that is at the top left of the models bounding box in a model editor
