Source code for Gravity Bone

Based on KMQuake2 by Knightmare
and includes Lazarus by David Hyde & Mad Dog.

Most code involves new gameplay objects in the game .dll. Note there's a fair amount of obsolete game objects that ended up not being used in Gravity Bone.

Minor modifications were made to the UI shell to remove the multiplayer menus, add support for checkboxes, and change some menu formating.

I've also included the GTKRadiant entities.def file used to make the maps.
