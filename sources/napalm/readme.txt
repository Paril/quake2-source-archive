                  Do NOT use 'weapprev' or 'weapnext'.


Description of the Modification
-------------------------------
All the weapons are given a second flame mode.  While in
flame mode, each weapon produces a fire-based attack that
can set opponents on fire!  Things that catch on fire will
lose health each second they burn.  If you start to burn,
find health or water to put out the fire.  Check the
manual.txt file for more details.


How to Install the Modification
-------------------------------
* Create a subdirectory called NAPALM within your QUAKE2
  directory.

* Extract gamex86.dll and pak0.pak files into your newly
  created NAPALM directory.

* Open a DOS shell, change to your QUAKE2 directory then
  type (without the quotes) 'quake2 +set game napalm'
  on the command line then press ENTER.
