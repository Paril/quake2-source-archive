Third Person Perspective for Quake 2 v1.3
=========================================

This is a proper 3rd person perspective camera for Quake2. Not like the CTF camera that follows another player this one actually allows you to play in 3rd person.

Installation
------------
Uncompress these 2 files into your quake2 directory and start Quake2 with the command line:

quake2 +set game thirdpp

Use
---
To use it just type 'thirdperson' at the console (without the speech marks) or bind a key to it. The camera will turn off when changing levels.
