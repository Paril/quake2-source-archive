ABOUT
-----
Those of you who have looked through the Quake2 code will notice the
m_actor.c file. This contains something that seems very cool - an actor
you can use in your levels. Unfortuanately, they never finished it. But
I have, and I've improved it a lot as well, so now you can use these
guys in your levels. Hooray! Look down below for a list of all the cool
things this mod can do...

Features:
[Features implemented originally]
-Actors can move like a train between points specified in the editor,
 doing actions at a point if you want them to
-Actors will do the taunt actions and insult the player if the player
 shoots them
-Actors will attack certain enemies that are specified by the map editor
[Features added by me]
-Actors now attack any enemy they come across 
-If an actor has nothing else to do, it will follow the player around
-They can have any weapon(chosen in map editor) except the Grenade/Rocket
 Launcher and BFG
-Actors use VWep
-Actors will not only get angry at the player but at other actors as well
-REALLY COOL FEATURE: If you set "pows" to 1 at the console, the guys
 locked up on the jail1-jail5 maps will become actors rather than insane
 guys. Cool, eh? Now they can help you.
-More coming in the next release

The source code is also available seperately.

INSTALLATION
------------
Unzip actor10.zip to a dir beneath Quake2 i.e. c:\quake2\actor
Run Quake2 with following command line
quake2 +set game <dir>
wher dir is the directory you installed the Actor to.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
I already know about the following stuph, but if find anything else
PLEASE e-mail me and tell me.
-Weapons aren't firing from the right position, haven't got around to
 fixing their offsets yet

USING THE DAMN THING IN YOUR MAPS
---------------------------------
Look in the accompanying 'custom.txt' file to find out how to:
-Use it in your maps
-Use custom models
-Waste time reading text files

OTHER STUFF
-----------
There's also an errors.txt file included which lists any QuakeActor error
codes that might pop up. I haven't finished implementing error codes, so
it's not very big yet.

If you have any ideas, find any bugs, have a question or just want to
comment, please e-mail me (cslash@yahoo.com). If you help me in a
significant way you will be credited.

LEGAL CRAP
----------
Basics of it is, if this frigs with your computer(I don't see how it can,
but I also don't see how John Howard can get elected), it ain't my fault.
Use this at your own risk.

If you want to stick this on a commercial CD, the answer is no unless you
give me a copy of the CD. Yes, I'm a freeloader. But you're getting this
for free, so you can't talk.

Feel free to distribute this along with any map you make that uses 
QuakeActor, AS LONG AS THIS README GOES WITH IT. You don't need to include
the custom.txt or erros.txt files though.

Enough bollocks, go have fun.
