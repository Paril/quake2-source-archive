To add items to maps
 ie type ctf_item item_armor_combat and where you are standing combat armor
will be there next time you load the map,unsure if you need to have bot_calc_nodes 1,but it does save this to the rtz file so you might,to remove all items type clear_items.if the level is already routed and you have to
turn on bot_calc_nodes to drop these make sure you turn it back off after you
drop something otherwise when you move you'll be adding extra routing info,
if this is the inital routing of a map dont worry about it.

partial list of dropable items:
item_armor_combat
item_armor_body
ammo_slugs
ammo_rockets
ammo_grenades
ammo_cells
ammo_shells
ammo_bullets

weapons will not work they are removed automatically from maps.....
