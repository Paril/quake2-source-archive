#
# OK, here's the deal. Bot's can say one of the following things:
#
# 1. Greetings
#
#  When a bot joins a team, or you join a bot's team, they'll usually
#  say hi. This depends on what they're doing at the time. If they're
#  not in battle, they'll usually give you a nice, warm welcome.
#
# 2. Insults
#
#  Ahh, the insult. What would Quake be without the old fashioned
#  insult. I bot will insult you randomly, depending on the status of
#  the game, so this section is divided into a few sub-sections:
#
#		a. The General Insults
#
#			Just your average, all-purpose insult.
#
#		b. Kicking your Ass
#
#			The bot will use these insults when he's beating you,
#			so these
#			won't make much sense if he's losing.
#
#		c. Losing
#
#			The bot is losing, but has just killed you. A come-
#			back is imminent.
#
# 3. Come-backs
#
#  I personally don't like being told to wipe the floor after I messed up.
#  Bots don't take to insults too well either, especially the good ones
#  who have an ego to defend.
#
# 4. TEAMPLAY: Help!
#
#  Some variations on the standard Help me, I'm in trouble! Note that if 
#  the bot is near an item such as the Rocket-Launcher, or Quad damage, 
#  they'll add a "Near the Rocket-Launcher!" to the end of the chat line.
#
# 5. TEAMPLAY: Drop item
#
#  Bot's will let others (on their team) know if they have excess items.
#  This provides some variety on they way they let you know.
#
# 6. TEAMPLAY: Let's Group!
#
#  A bot may decide he's going to coordinate an attack. If so, he will issue
#  one of these statements to the rest of his team, following by a location
#  specifier, like "I'm near the Rocket-Launcher". He will generally wait a
#  few second in that area, and then proceed. Other bot's will try to get to
#  the leader Bot in time, and will then follow him around the level.
#
#  Bot's will generally try to garner up a nice supply of weapons and ammo 
#  before doing this.
#
#
# NOTE: where you see a %s, that means a string goes there. All strings
#       must appear in the same order for each section.
