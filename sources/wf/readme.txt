Weapons Factory is made up of the following components:

Quake II (registered version)
Quake II 3.20 upgrade patch
Weapons Factory client software (.PAK file)
Weapons Factory GameSpy tab
Weapons Factory Maps
Weapons Factory server component (optional - for server operators only)
Installing Weapons Factory is actually quite easy if you already have Quake II installed. Simply follow the instructions below, in order.

Quake II
First of all, to play Weapons Factory, you must have Quake 2. Furthermore, it is recommended that you be a proficient player not only of Quake II, but also of network deathmatch and/or capture-the-flag play. Weapons Factory builds on these network games.

Second, you will need to have the Quake II version 3.2 upgrade.

Weapons Factory directory
Weapons Factory is designed to operate in its own subdirectory within the Quake2 directory. Thus you will need to create a subdirectory called "wf" within your "quake2" directory. Do this before proceeding.

You should also create a quake2\wf\maps directory for maps.

Weapons Factory client components
Next, you will need to install the WF files. Download the latest WF client file from the downloads page. Ths includes the pak5.pak file and the Weapons Factory gamespy tab. Unzip this file into your quake2\wf directory.

Assorted maps
Many of the WF servers will be running maps specifically designed for WF. New maps are constantly under development, and old maps are frequently revised. It is necessary to check the download section regularly.

Weapons Factory Maps (official WF maps)
If you have correctly installed current maps, then your quake2\wf\maps directory should look something like this:

Launching Weapons Factory
It is important to remember, however you choose to launch Quake 2 for Weapons Factory play, that the command line must instruct Quake 2 to run the Weapons Factory mod. The correct command line is:

quake2 +set game wf
It is highly recommended that you review the rest of the documentation in the Handbook before playing, as Weapons Factory is a complex game. Most features require special key bindings to operate. Please review these bindings here, rather than irritating other players by asking binding questions during a game.
