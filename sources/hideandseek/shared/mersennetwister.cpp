// This is the ``Mersenne Twister'' random number generator MT19937, which
// generates pseudorandom integers uniformly distributed in 0..(2^32 - 1)
// starting from any odd seed in 0..(2^32 - 1).  This version is a recode
// by Shawn Cokus (Cokus@math.washington.edu) on March 8, 1998 of a version by
// Takuji Nishimura (who had suggestions from Topher Cooper and Marc Rieffel in
// July-August 1997).
//
// Effectiveness of the recoding (on Goedel2.math.washington.edu, a DEC Alpha
// running OSF/1) using GCC -O3 as a compiler: before recoding: 51.6 sec. to
// generate 300 million random numbers; after recoding: 24.0 sec. for the same
// (i.e., 46.5% of original time), so speed is now about 12.5 million random
// number generations per second on this machine.
//
// According to the URL <http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html>
// (and paraphrasing a bit in places), the Mersenne Twister is ``designed
// with consideration of the flaws of various existing generators,'' has
// a period of 2^19937 - 1, gives a sequence that is 623-dimensionally
// equidistributed, and ``has passed many stringent tests, including the
// die-hard test of G. Marsaglia and the load test of P. Hellekalek and
// S. Wegenkittl.''  It is efficient in memory usage (typically using 2506
// to 5012 bytes of static data, depending on data type sizes, and the code
// is quite short as well).  It generates random numbers in batches of 624
// at a time, so the caching and pipelining of modern systems is exploited.
// It is also divide- and mod-free.
