Changes to the ref_gl OpenGL renderer

=========================================

* Defaults to trilinear filtering (looks nicer :)
* 32bit colour specified in PFD (instead of 24bit)
* 24bit Z, 8bit stencil
* Loads targas instead of other image formats where available
	- JPeg override added
	- Override looks for targa, then jpeg, then what was specified
* Entity shadows use stencil buffer
* Lowered shadows closer to the ground
* Dont rotate shadows on ungodly axis'
* Texture scripting
	- flushes all scripts not marked as safe on map change (previous maps scripts not kept in memory)
	- reloads all scripts on map change
	- scripts marked as safe not flushed
	- Some code by Heffo
		- Subdivide function
		- Vertex warp
		- .cin streaming
	- Some code by Vic
		- Rotate
		- Cleaned up code some
* Vertex arrays
	- On all drawing functions in gl_draw.c
	- On alias models
	- Renders with scripting
	- (Thanks to Q1 Twilight Project)
* Continuous frame exporting
	- Chews up HD space like mad
* Simple OpenGL state manager to avoid some unneccessary state changes
* Texture shader waterwarp on supported hardware
* Missing-texture image isnt a small crappy dot anymore
* ARB Texture compression
	- Heffo
* JPEG texture loading
	- JPEG screenshots
	- Heffo
* Fixed model shell rendering
* Targa particles
* Planar shadows arent drawn when they are above the view origin
* Motion Blur
* Smoother dynamic light falloff
	- Guy Paddock
* Stainmaps
	- Lord Havocs 'Dark Places'
		- Q2 port by Discoloda
	- 'gl_stainmaps' Cvar
	- Fixed up a bit by myself, help from Lord Havoc
	- No longer affects entity lighting
* Texture shader water not so bright anymore
* Hardware gammaramp
* Fixed 256x256 texture dimension limitation
	- Maximum texture size is 4096 or the video cards limit, whichever is lower
* Control framerate for cl_animdump
* Renderer now recognises the SURF_NODRAW surface flag


=========================================

To do... will I ever do these???

=========================================

* Cubic envmaps for scripts
* Volumetric fog
* Improve shadows
* fill the map list in the multiplayer menu from all maps in .pak files and the /maps folder
* mods menu
* fix cl_animdump to export to jpegs as well
* Actually do some of what I put in here
