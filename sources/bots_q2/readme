Quake 2 – BotS

Battle of the Sexes was a Quake 2 (Q3A, UT, who knows at this point?) team-based CTF mod created by Jesse “Spinoza” Herrera.

BotS was created to address the serious lack of good team mods for Quake2 in the absence of the holy grail that (at the time) was Team Fortress. BotS pitted teams of men (red) vs women (blue) in a class-based battle for supremacy across one of the deepest map landscapes of any FPS of the era.

I stepped into BotS early on in the Quake 2 (circa 1997) era and didn’t step back out again until before the UT version “launched”. It was a great time to be doing those things and playing a fun game. That said, given infinite time and money hats, Valve eventually gave us the real thing.

A BotS team (at least in Quake 2) was composed of a Captain, guardian of the promotion key, wielder of the BFG, and all-around bad-ass. (S)he was supported by an array of classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It has been said more than once that BotS was the “thinking (wo)mans” mod. Effective use of team composition and promotions would factor into victory just as much as skilled players.
