*** COMPILING Q2TETRIS ***

Unix/Linux:
	Move "Makefile.unix" to "Makefile".
	"make dep" to build dependencies.
	"make" will build the gamei386.so.
	This makefile assumes you have gcc and makedepend installed on your
	system.  (If you're running linux and aren't sure, you probably do.)
	
WindowsNT/95:
	MSDev build-- Jim Davis <hippie@multipro.com>
	LCC build-- Dustin Reyes <dareyes@tamu.edu>
	The lcc makefile is "Makefile.lcc"; the msdev project is "game.prj". 
	Thanks to these two gentlemen for their efforts.
