** STORY: **

Remember playing Quake2?  Remember running into your buddies?  Remember how
they were all clutching at their heads, moaning, and pleading for death?

This was the game that _they_ were playing...

** INSTRUCTIONS: **

Unzip q2tet.zip in your quake2 directory.  Start quake2 with the option

+set game tetris

on the command line.  Tetris should start directly.  Oh happy day.
