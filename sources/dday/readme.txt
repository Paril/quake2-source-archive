D-DAY: NORMANDY BETA SOURCE RELEASE-4-1

This is the D-Day: Normandy source for version 4.1. It is released under the GPL, a "copyleft" license, that is included in the release as gnu.txt. Basically, you can edit and compile this source to your liking, but if you release any binaries, or any part of the source, the rest of the source, these files, and the license must all be included. Make sure you read the license to better understand the terms.

 The source has been released in order to further the bug-stomping process. Should you find a bug, please use a 'diff' program to generate a patch file, or if it is small enough, just e-mail the fix to phil@planetquake.com. Please do not send the entire source file! 

 These are only the game, usa, and grm library source compilations.

 The Win32 project files were not included in the CVS repository and as such may need some reconfiguring (mainly output paths, etc) to suit your development needs.

 Should you run into any issues, please please please check out the forums at the D-Day: Normandy website before emailing Vipersoft:
