The Seriously Pissed off Bunny From Hell is out to get you!

Well actually, you need the client files first, which just contains the bunny model. Grab 'em from the link above and unzip with folders enabled to your Quake 2 directory. Once you have done that, read the instructions if you desire, then connect to a server of your choice.

Instructions:
One player is the bunny. The bunny has enhanced jumping (use attack and jump for different jumps) and vicious fangs, and starts with 150 health. The bunny cannot pick up any items, so it cannot heal itself (except for eating gibs), although it takes only 20% fall damage. The bunny should bounce around and eviscerate grunts by jumping on them.

All other players are normal Q2 grunts. The grunts shoot the bunny with whatever weapons they find. If the bunny is killed, the killer becomes the bunny immediately, with 2 secs of invulerability.

The client PAK also contains the server DLL: to start a server, launch a normal Q2 dm server then type the following at the console:

game bunny
map q2dm1

and you will be the proud owner of a Seriously Pissed off Bunny From Hell server!

Try it... you'll be surprised.
