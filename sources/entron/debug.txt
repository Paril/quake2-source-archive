Hi,
This is the debug version of Entron. It will be saved to quake2/Nodes.Log
once you load a map. Only the last loaded map will be logged. Older files
will be overwritten. The file has detailed information on what nodes are
connected to others. Please make sure that all nodes have at least one
adjacent node.
Cheers,
