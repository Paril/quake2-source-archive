==============================================================

This package contains the source code of SOG v1.2, as released on February 3, 2001. I do NOT claim full copyrights on all parts of the source-code because it bases and contains major key-source released by id-software. There's also source code included from other projects, such as "Generations" (http://www.planetquake.com/generations), the "ACE bot" (http://www.axionfx.com/ace) and the FMOD (http://www.fmod.org). Each of these source-elements are copyrighted by their respective owners.

You may NOT commercially exploit this work under any circumstances.

The files in this package can be used to re-create the binary code that is used to modify the game Quake 2 (by id software) for the mod "Some Old Games". The project files can be opened using MSVC6.

Also included in this package is the source code of the SOG Launcher. This code was developed with Delphi 3.

You are free to use this code in your own productions. Giving credits is not necessary, but will be appreciated.

Sound of the railgun still ringing in your ears, those damned Stroggos were the last straw. You fought the entire planet, took the saving of humanity on yourself, scarred yourself for life, and for what? To learn that the dead live again.

You open your eyes, and you're inside the storage room. Unsure how you got there -everything happened so fast- you recap everything you've been through. You remember the broken radio-link, and breaking an entry into the old technical building. You find two of your soldiers - and just then hear that cry. As if hearing it for the first time, it sends shivers down your spine again. Try not to think of the inhuman process he must have undergone to become one of those drooling zombies. Shit.

Everything else is blur. You try to organize your thoughts, it all seemed like happening in less than a second. The fireballs, those disgusting green slime balls; the electricity and that centaur looking thing. So many ugly creatures, it seems like time didn't really make a difference.

You try to think of a way out, but you know you're jammed. Noone will listen to your calls for help, and that furry white thing is waiting on the other side of the door. "Hell isn't a place for me" you think to yourself, stalling. But from the door in front of you you're already hearing the cries of more humans...


Welcome to SOG


Our goal is simple- to take the greatest elements of id Software's games, and combine them into a collage of classic 3D gaming for the Quake II engine. What was never possible in the originals, SOG will bring to you in vivid originality and production no less than perfect.

Our ultimate goal is to bring you the best q2-mod ever made, free of charge. We are making an entirely new game, one that you will not be able to put aside. SOG will offer sophisticated single player missions in every aspect - models, maps, sound, music and video; and the deathmatching experience will be rich like no other mod made.
