These are Known bugs in Chaotic Dreams v1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Airgun can push players through physical objects and get them stuck in walls

* Turrents are not destroyed by the Vortex

* Game occasionally sig11's in Linux and Segfaults in Win95, possibly memory
  leak somewhere (this will be painfull to fix)
// FWP One segfault cause (turret crash) fixed.  May be others.

* Bot AI needs improoved (supposed to be fixed by flash in some side code,
  need to intigrate this code into the main tree)

* Occasionally a Vortex grabs a player and pulls them through a wall

* Grapple hook can get stuck through a wall

* If you fakedeath while having the jetpack active the model animation is
  screwed up and locked into a STANDING position.  The problem is that i am
  not certain which is the bug, the model animation beeing screwed or the fact
  that they can fakedeath while using a jetpack.

* When a player reconnects with flashlight on the flashlight stays on

* Bugs with CTF spectator modes

* Changing a map during map rotation forces the rotation to stop
  (Partially fixed by "sv nextmap")

* Error messages appearing to clients "yada yada no such oldframe",seems to happen when player runs out of ammo and autoswitches to new weapon, also appears to be harmless.
