STARE!

[a Quake2 MOD by R1CH]

WTF??
Stare is a Quake 2 MOD with a twist on gameplay. Stealth is the key as you try to sneak up on your opponent and stare at them to kill them. Or perhaps you prefer a sniper role, staring into wide open spaces, killing all who enter your gaze.

All items are removed from normal maps. You can stare, and only stare. Simply line up your opponent in the crosshair and fire. Or sweep around a room with fire held down to kill all who enter your gaze. But beware, your mind can only take so much staring. The more you stare, the redder your screen becomes, obscuring your view. The redness fades after you stop staring. Stare too much and your mind will blow. Try it.

That's it really. A highly original, addictive MOD. LAN play is what this MOD (like NeurotiC and BANG) was designed for, although it should work perfectly well over the Internet. (side note: I made this while I was at a RoWeb LAN :)

There are two version of Stare!, a normal deathmatch and a new, CTF version. Stare those flag carriers down!
