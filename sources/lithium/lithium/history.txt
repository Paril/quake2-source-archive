----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found the bug that caused the occasional "ED_Alloc: no free edicts." fatal

run a vanilla server.  Change what you'd like.  Add "+exec x.cfg" to your
command line (replace x with lithium, normal, or a config file you created).
Note if you don't set a config file, the Lithium defaults will be used.
