Run A Server
If you'd like to run an OpenTDM server, please be aware that the mod is in active development and that you will need to check for updates regularly. The OpenTDM Game DLL should be placed in a directory called opentdm under the Quake II directory. Windows users can find development binaries in the binaries/unstable/win32/ directory. Linux users can find a binary in the binaries/unstable/linux/ directory. Where possible, please use the provided binaries as these include revision information and built in-curl for the web features of OpenTDM.

Source code is available on github. To check out the latest code from git, use git clone https://github.com/notr1ch/opentdm.git opentdm to checkout the current source into a directory called opentdm. Change to the opentdm directory and run make to create a gamei386.so or gamex86_64.so and run it using r1q2ded. To update, run git pull in the OpenTDM source folder, followed by make. If you get unusual behaviour, please try the binaries above before filing a bug report.

It is recommended to use the forked OpenTDM by Andrey Nazarov at https://github.com/AndreyNazarov/opentdm for bug fixes and improvements.
