Minor
-----
Force to spectator idle players in warmup.

Get free as in speech .wav files for hit sounds.

Web configs creation.

Votable hit sounds as well as per-player config.

Normal
------
Variable scoreboards, player can choose which they prefer. Default to some
similar to gxmod / battle or whatever people vote on.

Preferences system tied to guid, looks up preferenes (team name, skin, score
board style, hitsounds, etc) from opentdm.net.

Preserve teams on match end / map change (this will be more work than it seems
due to the teamplayers setup).

Use teamplayers instead of current clients for scoreboard and any other match
related info.

tdm_drop command, enhanced version of drop with minimum ammo ammounts and
other preferences. eg, tdm_drop rl 15 5 rg 10 cg 150 would mean
item <min_ammo_before_drop> [<ammo_to_drop>], item... and the first matching
one gets picked. Possibly values as % too to account for ammo pack.
Maybe even an intelligent version where if a teammate needs slugs and you hit
your drop RG bind, it finds the nearest friendly and doesn't drop the weapon
if they already have one, but maybe that's going too far?

Big
---
Web stats system. End of match, stats for players with a guid are POSTed with
libcurl to opentdm.net for some horribly big nasty stats / ranking system.
