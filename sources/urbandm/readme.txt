WELCOME ABOARD !
======================
*/
Well, what the hell is that new DM mod ? Still another imitation of Lithium ? Certainly
not...

This litlle (but kick ass !) DM mod was created first for the fun on my LAN, and then
oriented to the public when it started to look like a great mod. I've made it to allow
the Quake community to wait until UrbanCTF is out (hehehe...=) ! Have fun with it ! 
And thanks to have downloaded this litlle mod !

/*
======================
INSTALL
======================
*/
Unzip everything into a "UrbanDM" folder under your Quake2 one. Then run the RunMod.bat
file, and play ! Seems simple, he ? :)

/*
======================
FEATURES
======================
*/
(go have a cafe, and come back here before you start reading...)

	* VWEP supported
	* Improved Chasecam n°2 from QDevels
	* Feign Death command : self-explanatory !
	* Hyper-Jump : "hey ! I can see the moon !!"
	* Sadic Grenades : this grenade jump onto your opponent when close enough
	* Laser-Defence grenades
	* Winder gun : make your opponent loose all his guns !
	* Head Bonus : gib your opponent, and capture his head. Then if you kill someone
		       else, you'll get 1 frag + the num of heads you're carying. The
		       Max of heads is 5.
	* Head Kickage : once you've killed someone, he/she must wait 6 seconds before
			 respawning. During that time, you can play football with his/her
			 head ! Simply aim where you want the head to be kicked (i.e : a
			 goal), and run into the head ! :)
	* Locational Damage : Aim to the head for BIG damages !
	* Motd : edit the motd.txt to customize the welcome message when players enter the
		 game
	* Stats : show you some vital infos about you and the other players (health, 
		  head nums...)
	* more I can't remember... oh yes, you can kick other players once you've 
	  gibbed them... :)

/*
==============
THE COMMANDS !
==============
*/

Yes, I know, there're a lot of commands... I've included my spk.cfg for a key binding
sample.

Type the folowing commands at the quake2 console :

	* commands : show you all the mod commands

	* chasecam : switch between chasecam ON/OFF mods
	* camviewlock : allow you to choose an angle for the chasecam
	* camzoomin : zoom forward when chasecam is on
	* camzoomout : zoom backward when chasecam is on
	* stats : print Stats
	* feign : feign death !
	* laser : put a laser-defence, you'll need at least 5 cells
	* sadic : throw a sadic grenade, you'll need at least 2 grenades
	* jumper : perform an Hyper-Jump
	* use winder : use the Winder gun, you'll need at least 1 cell

/*
================================
BUGS (damn, I hate that word...)
================================
*/
	* The MuzzelFlash of the gun, when Chasecam is activated, stay where the chasecam
	  was first activated until chasecam come back off.
	* hadn't the time to test the boucing rocket behaviour when touching a player
	* nothing else very important...

	Please send me bug reports or anything like that to spk@captured.com.
